# Complementary Probability

Complementary probability refers to the likelihood of an event not happening. It is calculated by subtracting the probability of the event occurring from 1. This concept is based on the idea that the total probability of all possible outcomes is always 1. Therefore, if the probability of a specific event is known, the probability of it not occurring (its complement) can be easily determined. This is particularly useful in statistical analysis and prediction models.

$$
P(A') = 1 - P(A)
$$

Here, $P(A)$ represents the probability of an event A occurring, and $P(A')$ represents the probability of event A not occurring (the complement).

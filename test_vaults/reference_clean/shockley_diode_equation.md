# Shockley Diode Equation

The Shockley diode equation, named after William Shockley, the Nobel laureate and co-inventor of the transistor, describes the I-V (current-voltage) characteristics of a semiconductor diode. This equation is fundamental to the operation of diodes and transistors.

The equation is given as:

$$
I = I_s (e^{(V/nV_T)} - 1)
$$

Where:
- $I$ is the diode current,
- $I_s$ is the reverse bias saturation current (or scale current),
- $V$ is the voltage across the diode,
- $n$ is the ideality factor, also known as the quality factor or sometimes the emission coefficient,
- $V_T$ is the thermal voltage, which is approximately $25.85$ mV at room temperature (300 K).

The equation essentially states that the current through the diode ($I$) is equal to the reverse saturation current ($I_s$) times the quantity of the exponential of the voltage across the diode divided by the product of the ideality factor and the thermal voltage, minus one.

The ideality factor $n$ is a measure of how closely the diode follows the ideal diode equation. For real diodes, $n$ can vary from 1 to 2 depending on the fabrication process and semiconductor material and in some cases, it can be even more than 2.

The reverse bias saturation current, $I_s$, is the tiny electric current that can be measured flowing in the reverse direction when a diode is reverse-biased and the electric field from the applied voltage causes a very small number of thermally excited carriers to cross the junction.

The Shockley diode equation is derived from the law of mass action, which states that the product of the electron and hole densities in a semiconductor is constant at a given temperature, provided no external forces are acting. The equation is also based on the assumption that the diode is in thermal equilibrium.

The equation is used to model the behavior of semiconductor diodes, which are fundamental components in many electronic devices. It is also used in the analysis and design of various electronic circuits that use diodes.

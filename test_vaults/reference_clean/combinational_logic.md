# Combinational Logic

Combinational logic refers to a type of digital logic which is implemented by Boolean circuits, where the output is a pure function of the present input only. This means that unlike sequential logic, combinational logic does not have an internal state, i.e., it does not use memory or feedback. The value of the output in combinational logic depends solely on the values given to the input at that particular instance in time. Examples of combinational logic include binary adders, subtractors, multipliers, decoders, encoders, multiplexers, etc.

This means that DFFs, or RS Latches are not combinational circuits.

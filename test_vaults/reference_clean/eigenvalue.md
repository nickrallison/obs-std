# Eigenvalue

An eigenvalue is a scalar that is used in linear algebra, particularly in matrix theory. It arises from the equation $Ax = \lambda x$, where A is a square matrix, x is a vector, and Î» is the eigenvalue. This equation signifies that the action of the matrix A only stretches or shrinks the vector x, without changing its direction. Eigenvalues are crucial in various fields such as physics and engineering for solving systems of linear equations, analyzing population growth models, and understanding physical phenomena like vibration of systems.

# CMOS Logic Gate

A CMOS Logic Gate is a type of digital logic gate that uses Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology to operate. It is used in many types of electronic products including microprocessors, memory chips, and other digital logic circuits. The main advantage of CMOS technology is its low power consumption which makes it ideal for use in battery-powered devices. CMOS Logic Gates also have high noise immunity and are highly effective at minimizing current leakage, further enhancing their energy efficiency.

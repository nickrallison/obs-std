# Computability

Computability refers to the ability to solve a problem in an effective manner. It is a key concept in computer science and mathematics, particularly in the theory of computation, where it is used to determine what can and cannot be computed by algorithms. Computability studies the limitations and abilities of computers in solving problems and includes concepts like computable functions, complexity theory, and algorithmic information theory. It helps in understanding which problems can theoretically be solved on a computer and the resources required for their solutions.

An example of a non-computable problem is the Busy Beaver Series. Where finding the $n^{th}$ busy beaver number requires enumerating every Turing Machine of size $n$

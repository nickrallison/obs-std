# Surjective

Surjective, also known as onto, is a term used in mathematics, specifically in the field of functions. A function is said to be surjective if every element of the function's codomain can be paired with at least one element of its domain. In simpler terms, it means that every possible output (value in the codomain) is produced by at least one input (value in the domain). This ensures that no part of the codomain is left unmapped by the function.

# Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is a central theorem in calculus that establishes a connection between differentiation and integration, two fundamental operations in calculus. It consists of two parts: the first part provides an explicit formula to compute the definite integral of a function, while the second part states that the derivative of an integral of a function is that original function. This theorem allows us to solve complex problems related to areas, volumes, and changes in quantities.

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is typically expressed in two parts as follows:

Part 1:
$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

where $F(x)$ is the antiderivative of $f(x)$.

Part 2:
$$
\frac{d}{dx} \int_{a}^{x} f(t) \, dt = f(x)
$$

This has connection to Stokesâ€™ Theorem which is basically a higher dimensional version of the fundamental theorem of calculus

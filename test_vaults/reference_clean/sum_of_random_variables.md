# Sum of Random Variables

When random variables are summed together the resulting random variable can be represented as a probability distribution of the convolution of the individual elements. The distribution of this sum will depend on the distributions of the individual variables being added. For instance, if two or more independent random variables have normal (Gaussian) distributions, their sum will also have a normal distribution.

The formula for the probability distribution is the convolution of the individual random variableâ€™s probability distribution

X = X_1 * X_2

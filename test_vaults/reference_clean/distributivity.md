# Distributivity

Distributivity is a fundamental property in mathematics that applies to both numbers and operations. It's a rule that sets out how multiplication interacts with addition and subtraction. The distributive property states that multiplying a number by a set of numbers added together is the same as doing each multiplication separately. For example, in arithmetic, the distributive property of multiplication over addition can be illustrated as follows: a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c). This principle simplifies complex mathematical equations and expressions, making them easier to solve or understand.

$$
\begin{gather*} 
a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)
\end{gather*}
$$

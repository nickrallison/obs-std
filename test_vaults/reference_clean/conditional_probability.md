# Conditional Probability

Conditional probability is a concept in probability theory that calculates the probability of an event given the occurrence of another event. It is used to quantify the likelihood of a certain event happening, assuming that another related event has already happened. This concept is crucial in various fields such as statistics, finance, medicine, and artificial intelligence. The formula for conditional probability is $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}\text{, where }P(A|B)$ represents the probability of event A given that event B has occurred.

The above formula is a different representation of Bayes' Theorem
$$
\text{P}(A|B) = \frac{\text{P}(B|A)\text{P}(A)}{\text{P}(B)}
$$

Where 
$$
\text{P}(B|A)\text{P}(A) = \text{P}(A|B)\text{P}(B) = \text{P}(A\cap B)
$$

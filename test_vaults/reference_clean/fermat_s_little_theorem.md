# Fermat's Little Theorem

Fermats Little Theorem is a fundamental theorem in number theory, named after Pierre de Fermat. It states that if p is a prime number and a is an integer not divisible by p, then a raised to the power of p-1 is congruent to 1 modulo p. In simpler terms, it means that the remainder when a to the power of p-1 is divided by p is 1. This theorem provides a method for checking whether a number is prime and forms the basis for several algorithms in public-key cryptography.

a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p

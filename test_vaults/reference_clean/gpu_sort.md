# GPU Sort

GPU sort is a sorting method that utilizes the processing power of a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) to sort data. This is particularly useful for large sets of data, as GPUs are designed to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, making them more efficient for this purpose than CPUs. The process involves dividing the data into chunks that can be sorted in parallel, which significantly speeds up the sorting process. This method is commonly used in fields that require the processing of large amounts of data, such as big data analysis and scientific computing. 

Like a brute force version of Bubble Sort.

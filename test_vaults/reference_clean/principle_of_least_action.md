# Principle of Least Action

The Principle of Least Action, or the action principle, is a variational principle that, when applied to the action of a mechanical system, can be used to obtain the equations of motion for that system. The action principle is a cornerstone in modern physics, being at the heart of the formulation of quantum mechanics, general relativity, and quantum field theory.

The action is defined as the integral over time of a system's Lagrangian:

$$
S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(q, \dot{q}, t) dt
$$

where $L$ is the Lagrangian function, which is the difference between the kinetic and potential energy of the system, $q$ represents the generalized coordinates of the system, $\dot{q}$ is the time derivative of these coordinates (i.e., their velocities), and $t$ is time.

The Principle of Least Action states that the path taken by the system between times $t_1$ and $t_2$ is the one for which the action $S$ is stationary (i.e., at a minimum, maximum, or saddle point). This is expressed mathematically by the condition $\delta S = 0$, where $\delta$ denotes a variation in the action.

This condition leads to the Euler-Lagrange equations, which are the equations of motion of the system:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} = 0
$$

The Principle of Least Action provides a powerful and elegant method for formulating the dynamics of physical systems. It is particularly useful in systems with many degrees of freedom, where the Newtonian approach can become cumbersome.

Tangentially related items include Hamilton's principle, Noether's theorem, and Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. Hamilton's principle is a reformulation of the principle of least action in terms of the Hamiltonian, which is another function used to describe the system. Noether's theorem states that every differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law. Feynman's path integral formulation extends the principle of least action to quantum mechanics by considering all possible paths, not just the one for which the action is stationary.

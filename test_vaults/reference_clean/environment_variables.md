# Environment Variables

Environment variables are a feature of operating systems that allow you to set global values for your system or specific applications. They are used to customize the system environment to meet the users' specific needs.

An environment variable is essentially a name-value pair stored in the operating system's memory. The name of the variable is a reference to its value, which can be a number, a string, or any other data type. These variables are typically used to store system settings, directory paths, program locations, and other configuration data.

For example, in a Unix-based system like Linux or MacOS, the `PATH` environment variable is used to list directories that the shell searches for executable files. In Windows, `PATH` serves a similar purpose.

Environment variables can be set at different levels:

1. **System level**: These variables are set for the entire system and are available to all users. Changes to these variables may require administrative access.

2. **User level**: These variables are specific to the individual user's environment. They can be set by the user and only affect that user's processes.

3. **Process level**: These variables are specific to a particular process and are typically set by the program that starts the process.

In programming, environment variables are often used to store sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials, that should not be hard-coded into the program itself. This practice enhances the security and portability of the code.

In terms of formulas, derivations, or proofs, these concepts are not typically associated with environment variables as they are more of a practical tool used in system configuration and programming rather than a theoretical concept.

# Referencing vs. Dereferencing

Referencing and dereferencing are fundamental concepts in computer science, particularly in programming languages that allow direct manipulation of memory, such as C and C++. 

**Referencing**

Referencing is the process of creating a reference to a variable, object, function, or data stored in memory. A reference is essentially an alias or another name for an existing variable. When you create a reference, you're creating a second way to refer to the same data. 

In C++, for example, you can create a reference to an existing variable like this:

```cpp
int x = 10;
int& ref = x;
```

In this case, `ref` is a reference to `x`. Any changes made to `ref` will also affect `x`, because they both refer to the same data in memory.

**Dereferencing**

Dereferencing is the process of accessing the data to which a pointer refers. A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. When you dereference a pointer, you're accessing the data stored at the memory address the pointer contains.

In C++, you can dereference a pointer like this:

```cpp
int x = 10;
int* ptr = &x;
int y = *ptr;
```

In this case, `ptr` is a pointer to `x`, and `*ptr` dereferences the pointer, accessing the data stored at the memory address it contains. The value of `y` is now 10, the same as `x`.

**Tangentially Related Concepts**

1. **[[Pointer.md|Pointers]]**: As mentioned above, pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable. They are central to the concepts of referencing and dereferencing.

2. **Memory Management**: Understanding referencing and dereferencing is crucial for effective memory management in languages like C and C++, which do not have automatic garbage collection.

3. **Data Structures**: Many data structures, such as linked lists and trees, rely heavily on pointers, referencing, and dereferencing.

4. **Pass by Reference vs. Pass by Value**: When passing arguments to a function, you can choose to pass by reference (the function receives a reference and can modify the original data) or pass by value (the function receives a copy of the data and cannot modify the original).

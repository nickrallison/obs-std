# Associativity

Associativity is a fundamental concept in mathematics and logic, referring to the property that the grouping of numbers or variables in an operation does not change the final result. This principle applies to operations like addition and multiplication. For example, in addition, (2 + 3) + 4 equals 2 + (3 + 4) - both equal 9. In multiplication, similarly, (2 * 3) * 4 equals 2 * (3 * 4) - both equal 24. However, this property doesn't hold for all operations; subtraction and division are not associative. For example, (5 - 2) -1 does not equal to 5 - (2 -1).

In addition:  
$$(2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4)$$

In multiplication:  
$$(2 * 3) * 4 = 2 * (3 * 4)$$

Non-associativity in subtraction:  
$$(5 - 2) -1 \neq 5 - (2 -1)$$

## Associativity of Groups

In the context of group theory in mathematics, associativity is a fundamental property that defines a group. A group is a set of elements combined with an operation that satisfies four conditions: closure, associativity, identity and invertibility.

The associativity rule in group theory states that for all elements a, b, and c in the group, the equation (a * b) * c equals a * (b * c) must hold true. This means that no matter how the elements are grouped in the operation, the result will be the same. 

For example, consider the group of integers under addition. The associativity rule applies because for any three integers x, y, and z, (x + y) + z equals x + (y + z). 

However, not all operations on sets form groups. For example, the set of positive integers under subtraction does not form a group because subtraction is not associative. For instance, for the numbers 5, 2 and 1: (5 - 2) - 1 equals 2, but 5 - (2 - 1) equals 4. 

So in summary, associativity is a key property in group.

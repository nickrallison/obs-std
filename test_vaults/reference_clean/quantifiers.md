# Quantifiers

Can you summarize what quantifiers are in the context of proofs:

Quantifiers in the context of proofs refer to symbols or words used to specify the quantity or scope of the variables under consideration. There are two primary types of quantifiers: universal and existential.
1. Universal Quantifier: Often represented by the symbol ∀ (for all), it states that a certain property holds for all members of a domain. For example, in the statement "For all x, if x is a bird, then x can fly," the universal quantifier is "for all."
2. Existential Quantifier: Often represented by the symbol ∃ (there exists), it states that there is at least one member in the domain for which a property holds true. For example, in the statement "There exists an x such that x is a bird and x cannot fly," the existential quantifier is "there exists."  
In proofs, using correct quantifiers is crucial for accurately defining mathematical statements and logical arguments.

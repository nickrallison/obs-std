# Axiom Of Pairing

The Axiom of Pairing is a fundamental concept in set theory, a branch of mathematical logic. It basically states that for any two sets, there is a set that contains them both as elements. This axiom allows the formation of pairs of objects and it's one of the foundational axioms in the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. It permits the construction of new sets from existing ones, facilitating mathematical proofs and operations.

## Simple Explanation

The Axiom of Pairing is a rule in set theory that says you can always make a new set from the union of any two existing sets.

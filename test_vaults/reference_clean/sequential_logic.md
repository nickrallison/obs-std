# Sequential Logic

Sequential logic is a type of logic circuit where the output depends not only on the present input but also on the history of the input. This is in contrast to combinational logic, where the output is a function of only the present input. In sequential logic, the output is determined by a sequence of inputs over time. This type of logic is used in digital circuits, such as flip-flops, latches, and registers, which have memory capabilities. Sequential logic is fundamental in creating state machines and is widely used in digital systems like computers and calculators.

# Contrapositive

Contrapositive refers to a type of logical argument or statement in which the original statement and its contrapositive will always have the same truth value. It is formed by negating and reversing the hypothesis and conclusion of a statement. For example, if the original statement is "If it is raining, then I am inside," the contrapositive would be "If I am not inside, then it is not raining." Both statements are logically equivalent.

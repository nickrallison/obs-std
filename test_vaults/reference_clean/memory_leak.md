# Memory Leak

A memory leak refers to a specific type of unintentional memory consumption by a computer program where the program does not return the memory that it has acquired for temporary use. This happens when objects are stored in the memory but are not accessible by the running code. Over time, a memory leak can cause a program to consume increasing amounts of memory, slowing down the system or even causing the program or entire system to crash. Memory leaks are particularly problematic in languages like C and C++, which don't have built-in garbage collection.

# Moore Machine

A Moore Machine is a type of finite state machine in the field of digital electronics and computer science. It is named after Edward F. Moore, a pioneer in this field. The machine is characterized by its outputs, which are determined solely by its current state, not by its inputs. This means that changes in input values dont immediately affect the output, providing a level of stability in operation. Moore Machines are used in applications such as sequence detectors and control unit operations in computers.

# Hall Effect

The Hall Effect is a phenomenon in physics discovered by Edwin Hall in 1879. It occurs when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the direction of current flow in a conductive material, resulting in a voltage difference across the material. This voltage, known as the Hall voltage, can be used to measure the strength of the magnetic field. The Hall Effect is also used to determine whether a material is a conductor, insulator, or semiconductor and to find out the type and density of charge carriers in it. It has practical applications in various devices such as magnetometers, Hall effect sensors, and in the semiconductor industry.

The Hall voltage (V_H) can be represented by the following formula:

$$
\begin{gather*} 
V_H = \frac{IB}{nte}
\end{gather*}
$$

where:
- $I$ is the current,
- $B$ is the magnetic field strength,
- $n$ is the charge carrier density,
- $t$ is the thickness of the material,
- $e$ is the elementary charge.

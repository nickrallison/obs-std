# Continuous Distribution

A continuous distribution, in statistics, represents the probabilities of possible outcomes for a continuous random variable, which can take on an infinite number of possible values within a specified range. This is different from a discrete distribution, where the variable can only take specific values. Examples of continuous distributions include normal distribution, exponential distribution, and uniform distribution. The probability of a continuous random variable taking on a specific value is typically zero; instead, probabilities are associated with ranges of values. The total probability across the entire range of a continuous random variable is equal to 1.

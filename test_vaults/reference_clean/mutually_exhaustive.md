# Mutually Exhaustive

In statistics and probability theory, mutually exhaustive events are events that cover all possible outcomes of a particular experiment or scenario. It means that at least one of the events must occur when an experiment is conducted. For example, if we toss a coin, the mutually exhaustive events are: the coin lands on heads or the coin lands on tails. These two possibilities cover all potential outcomes. Thus, they are collectively exhaustive and at least one of them is bound to occur. This concept is vital for calculating probabilities accurately. If some items are mutually exhaustive, then we know that the events span the entire Sample Space, and are guarantied to occur.

# Axiom Of Infinity

The Axiom of Infinity is a fundamental concept in set theory, a branch of mathematical logic. It states that there exists an infinite set, specifically a set that contains the number zero and the successor of every number it contains. This axiom allows for the creation of an infinite series of natural numbers within the framework of set theory and ensures that infinite objects are part of our mathematical universe. Without this axiom, all sets would be finite and many mathematical concepts would not exist.

Basically this axiom guarantees the existence of the following set:
$$
\{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}, \{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}\}, \{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}, \{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}\}\}, ...\}
$$
 Where $\varnothing$ maps to 0, $\{\varnothing\}$ maps to 1, â€¦
 
## Simple Explanation

The Axiom of Infinity is a rule that says there exists a set that contains the number zero and for every number in the set, the next number is also in the set.

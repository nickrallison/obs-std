# Soundness and Completeness

Soundness and completeness are two important concepts in logic and reasoning. Soundness refers to the ability of an argument or proof to be valid, meaning that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In other words, a sound argument is one where the conclusion follows logically from the premises.

On the other hand, completeness refers to the ability of an argument or proof to cover all possible cases or counterarguments. A complete argument or proof is one that has considered and refuted all possible objections or opposing views. In this sense, a complete argument is one that is able to withstand any potential counter-attack or criticism.

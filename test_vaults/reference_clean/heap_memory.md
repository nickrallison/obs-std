# Heap Memory

Heap memory, also known as dynamic memory, is a region of a computer's memory that is used for dynamic memory allocation. It is called a "heap" because it is a pile of memory space available to programmers to allocated and de-allocate. If a program uses more memory space, it can request more from the heap; if it uses less, it can return memory back to the heap.

Heap memory is managed via two key operations: allocation and deallocation. Allocation involves reserving a block of memory on the heap for use by the program, while deallocation involves returning a previously allocated block back to the heap. These operations are typically performed using functions such as `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()`, and `free()` in C and C++.

Heap memory is different from stack memory, which is used for Static Memory Allocation. While stack memory is automatically managed by the computer, heap memory is manually managed by the programmer. This gives more flexibility but also introduces the possibility of errors such as memory leaks (forgetting to deallocate memory) and dangling pointers (pointers pointing to deallocated memory).

Heap memory is also non-contiguous, meaning that blocks of memory can be scattered throughout the heap. This contrasts with stack memory, which is contiguous and organized as a stack of memory blocks.

Heap memory is crucial for many data structures and algorithms. For example, data structures such as trees and graphs are often implemented using dynamically allocated nodes on the heap. Similarly, algorithms that require variable-size or large amounts of memory often use heap memory.

In terms of formulas, heap memory doesn't have specific formulas associated with it. However, the time complexity of heap operations can be important in algorithm analysis. For example, in a Heap Data Structure.md|binary heap data structure]], the time complexity of insertion and deletion operations is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the heap.

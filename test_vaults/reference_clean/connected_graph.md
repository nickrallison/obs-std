# Connected Graph

A connected graph is a type of graph in which there is a path from any point to any other point in the graph. This means that every pair of vertices in the graph is connected. In other words, there are no isolated vertices. Connected graphs are important in various fields such as computer science, network theory, and operations research because they help to model and solve problems where connectivity is a crucial factor.

# Supersets

A superset in mathematics is a set that contains all elements of another set, including any additional elements. For example, if we have a set A = {1, 2, 3} and a set B = {1, 2, 3, 4}, then B is a superset of A because it contains all elements of A plus an additional element.

$$
\begin{gather*} 
A = \{1, 2, 3\} \\
B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \\
B \supseteq A 
\end{gather*}
$$

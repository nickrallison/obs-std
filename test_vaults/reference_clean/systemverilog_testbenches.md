# SystemVerilog Testbenches

SystemVerilog is a hardware description and hardware verification language used to model, design, and verify electronic systems. A testbench in SystemVerilog is a framework that sets up the necessary environment to verify the correctness of a particular design. It's essentially a program that tests the functionality of another program.

A typical SystemVerilog testbench includes the following components:

1. **DUT (Device Under Test)**: This is the actual design that you want to test. It could be a module, an interface, or any other design entity.

2. **Stimulus**: This is the input that you provide to the DUT. It can be generated manually or by using automatic stimulus generation tools.

3. **Checker**: This component checks the output of the DUT against the expected output. It can be as simple as an `if` statement comparing two values or as complex as a self-checking testbench that automatically verifies the correctness of the DUT.

4. **Monitor**: This component observes and records the behavior of the DUT during simulation. It can be used for debugging purposes or for post-simulation analysis.

5. **Scoreboard**: This component is used in self-checking testbenches to store expected results and compare them with actual results.

6. **Coverage Collector**: This component measures how much of the DUT's functionality has been exercised by the testbench.

Here's a simple example of a SystemVerilog testbench:

```systemverilog
module tb;
  // DUT
  adder dut();

  // Stimulus
  reg a, b;
  wire sum;

  initial begin
    $dumpfile("adder.vcd");
    $dumpvars(0, tb);

    a = 0; b = 0; #10;
    a = 0; b = 1; #10;
    a = 1; b = 0; #10;
    a = 1; b = 1; #10;

    $finish;
  end

  // Checker
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (sum !== a + b)
      $display("Test failed at time %t: sum=%b, expected=%b", $time, sum, a + b);
  end

  // DUT instantiation
  adder u1 (.a(a), .b(b), .sum(sum));
endmodule
```

In this example, `adder` is the DUT, and the testbench applies different combinations of inputs `a` and `b`, checks the output `sum` against the expected result, and displays an error message if the output is incorrect.

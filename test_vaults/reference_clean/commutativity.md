# Commutativity

Commutativity is a fundamental property in mathematics that applies to binary operations. It states that changing the order of the operands does not change the result. It is a key aspect of many mathematical operations and structures.

The most familiar commutative operations are addition and multiplication of numbers. That is, if $a$ and $b$ are any numbers, then:

1. Addition: $a + b = b + a$
2. Multiplication: $a \times b = b \times a$

This property does not hold for all operations. For example, subtraction and division are not commutative: $a - b \neq b - a$ and $a \div b \neq b \div a$ for most values of $a$ and $b$.

In more abstract algebra, we often talk about sets with a binary operation. A set $S$ with a binary operation $\circ$ is said to be commutative if for all $a, b \in S$, we have $a \circ b = b \circ a$.

For example, the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ with the operation of addition "+" is commutative because for all integers $a$ and $b$, $a + b = b + a$.

## Commutator

The concept of commutativity extends beyond numbers and algebra. For example, in the field of quantum mechanics, operators are said to commute if their commutator is zero. The commutator of two operators $A$ and $B$ is defined as $[A, B] = AB - BA$. If $[A, B] = 0$, then $A$ and $B$ commute, which has important implications in the simultaneous measurability of quantum observables.

# Probability Density Function

The Probability Density Function (PDF) is a statistical expression that defines a probability distribution for a continuous random variable as opposed to a discrete random variable. The PDF is used to specify the probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values, as opposed to taking on any one value. This probability is given by the integral of this variableâ€™s PDF over that range. The PDF is non-negative everywhere, and its integral over the entire space is equal to one.

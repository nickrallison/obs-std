# Naive Set Theory

"Naive Set Theory" is a non-technical, basic introduction to mathematical set theory. It's called 'naive' because it doesn't require rigorous formal logic or axiomatic systems that are used in the more advanced set theories. In naive set theory, sets are collections of objects which can be defined by their properties. It serves as the mathematical basis for nearly every other part of mathematics and is used in understanding number systems, geometry, and logic. Despite its simplicity, naive set theory can lead to paradoxes when not handled carefully. 

The formal, axiomatic version of Naive Set Theory would be Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory.

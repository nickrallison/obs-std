# Empiricism

Empiricism is a philosophical doctrine that posits that knowledge comes primarily, or even exclusively, from sensory experience. It is one of the foundational elements of the scientific method, which relies on observation and experimentation to understand the world. Empiricism is often contrasted with rationalism, which posits that knowledge can be gained independently of the senses, through reason and logical deduction.

The roots of empiricism can be traced back to ancient Greek philosophy, but it was during the Age of Enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries that it became a dominant philosophical view. Key figures in the development of empiricism include John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume, who are often referred to as the British Empiricists.

John Locke proposed the idea of the mind as a "tabula rasa" or blank slate, arguing that all our knowledge comes from experience. George Berkeley took this a step further with his theory of "immaterialism," arguing that the only things that exist are minds and their ideas. David Hume, meanwhile, is known for his radical empiricism, which led him to skepticism about the existence of certain general features of the world, such as causality and the self.

Empiricism has had a profound influence on a wide range of fields, including not only philosophy but also psychology, economics, and political science. In these fields, empirical research methods are used to gather data and test theories.

In the context of mathematics and logic, empiricism is less directly applicable, as these fields are typically seen as areas of a priori knowledge, which is knowledge that can be gained independently of experience. However, there are some philosophers, known as "empiricists" in the philosophy of mathematics, who argue that mathematical knowledge is ultimately grounded in sensory experience.

# Bilinear Interpolation

Bilinear Interpolation is a method in mathematical analysis used for estimating the value of a function for two variables when given a set of data points. It's applied in image processing for tasks like resizing and transformation. The technique involves performing linear interpolation first in one direction, and then again in the other direction - hence the term 'bilinear'. It allows for smooth transitions and gradients, rather than abrupt changes in value, providing a more realistic output.

Not as smooth as a Bicubic Interpolation. Simpler computationally.

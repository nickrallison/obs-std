# Axiom Of Regularity

The Axiom of Foundation, is a principle in set theory, a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets. It states that every non-empty set contains an element that is disjoint from the set. In simpler terms, it means that there are no infinite sequences of sets where each set is contained in the next one. This axiom helps to avoid paradoxes and contradictions in set theory.

## Simple Explanation

The Axiom of Regularity is a rule that says no set can contain an endless sequence of sets within each other.

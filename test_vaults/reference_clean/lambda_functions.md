# Lambda Functions

Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are small, inline functions in Python that are defined using the lambda keyword. They can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. Lambda functions are used when a small function is needed temporarily and it's not worth defining it with a proper function statement. They are often used in conjunction with map(), filter() and reduce() functions.

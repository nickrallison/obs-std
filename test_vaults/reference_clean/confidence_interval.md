# Confidence Interval

A confidence interval is a range of values, derived from a statistical model, that is likely to contain an unknown population parameter. It provides an estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter, the estimated uncertainty being denoted by the confidence level. This interval is often used in various forms of data analysis and research to estimate the degree of certainty we have about the results of a test or experiment. The confidence level (usually expressed as a percentage, e.g., 95%) quantifies the level of confidence that the parameter lies within the stated interval.

The concept of confidence interval does not have a single formula, but it can be generally represented in the following way:

$$
\begin{gather*}
CI = \bar{X} \pm Z \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
\end{gather*}
$$

Where:
- $CI$ represents the confidence interval.
- $\bar{X}$ is the sample mean.
- $Z$ is the Z-score, which corresponds to the desired confidence level.
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the population.
- $n$ is the size of the sample.

# Mealy Machine

A Mealy Machine is a type of finite state machine used in digital logic and computer science to design sequential logic circuits. It is named after George H. Mealy, who presented the concept in a 1955 paper. The machine consists of states and transitions, where each transition is labeled with an input-output pair. This means that the output of a Mealy Machine depends not only on its current state but also on the current inputs, making it a type of "input-output" machine. This characteristic allows Mealy Machines to have fewer states than other types of finite state machines for certain tasks, making them more efficient in some cases.

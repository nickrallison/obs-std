# Inner Product

The inner product, also known as the dot product, is a fundamental concept in vector algebra and geometry. Its a type of multiplication that takes two vectors and produces a scalar (a single number).

In a geometric sense, the inner product of two vectors represents the cosine of the angle between them, scaled by the product of their magnitudes. This makes it useful for various applications such as determining orthogonality (if the inner product is zero, the vectors are orthogonal or perpendicular), computing angles between vectors, and projecting one vector onto another.

In terms of notation, if we have two vectors A and B, their inner product is often denoted as ⟨A,B⟩ or sometimes A·B.

The inner product can be generalized to more abstract spaces beyond three-dimensional space, such as function spaces. This generalization leads to an important concept in mathematics called an "inner product space", which is a key structure in linear algebra and functional analysis.
$$
\begin{gather*} 
\langle A, B \rangle = A \cdot B \\
\end{gather*}
$$

Given two vectors, $A = [1, 2, 3]$ and $B = [4, 5, 6]$, find their inner product:

$$
\begin{gather*} 
A = [1,2,3] \\
B = [4,5,6] \\
\text{The inner product of } A \text{ and } B \text{ is:} \\
A\cdot B = (1*4) + (2*5) + (3*6) \\
A\cdot B = 4 + 10 + 18 \\
A\cdot B = 32
\end{gather*}
$$

# Disconnected Graph

A disconnected graph is a type of graph in which some vertices are not connected by edges. This means that there are some points in the graph that cannot be reached from other points. In other words, a graph is disconnected if at least two nodes in the graph have no path connecting them. This is in contrast to a connected graph, where every pair of vertices is connected by some path. Disconnected graphs can be made up of several disconnected subgraphs or "components".

This is the opposite of a connected graph, there exists a path from every node to every other node

# Russell's Paradox

Russell's Paradox is a problem discovered by Bertrand Russell in 1901, which exposed an inconsistency in naive set theory. It questions whether a set of all sets that do not contain themselves contains itself or not. If it does, then by definition it should not. But if it does not, then it fits the criteria and should be included. This paradox led to the development of more sophisticated forms of set theory (ZF / ZFC) and had significant implications for the philosophy of mathematics.

## Further

This is not just some small hole in set theory. The rules of naive set theory are fundamental rules of propositional logic, the idea of an item being contained in a set is the same as a proposition applying to the object. In addition to that, propositions can be objects.

The equivalent paradox in propositional logic would be

“Is not a proposition” is not a proposition

This is a perfectly valid sentence according to the rules of logic. And this is a contradiction, at the heart of logic itself.

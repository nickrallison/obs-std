# Axiom Of Replacement

The Axiom of Replacement is a principle in set theory, a branch of mathematical logic, that essentially states if you have a set and a property or rule that each member of that set adheres to, then there exists another set where each member is the result of applying this rule to the original set. This axiom is used to construct sets from existing ones in a precise and controlled manner. It helps ensure that only 'legitimate' sets are formed, preventing paradoxes and inconsistencies within the theory.

## Simple Explanation

The Axiom of Replacement is a rule that allows you to create a new set by replacing each item in an existing set with another item, according to a certain rule.

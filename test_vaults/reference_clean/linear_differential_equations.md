# Linear Differential Equations

Linear Differential Equations are a type of differential equation, a mathematical equation that relates some function with its derivatives. In applications, the functions usually represent physical quantities, the derivatives represent their rates of change, and the equation defines a relationship between the two.

A linear differential equation is any differential equation that can be written in the following form:

$$
a_n(x)y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}(x)y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1(x)y' + a_0(x)y = g(x)
$$

where $y^{(n)}$ denotes the $n$-th derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$, $a_i(x)$ are the coefficient functions, and $g(x)$ is the source term. The order of a differential equation is defined by the highest order derivative present in the equation.

The above equation is said to be linear because each term is either a constant times the function $y$ or a constant times a derivative of $y$. The equation is also homogeneous if $g(x) = 0$; otherwise, it's nonhomogeneous.

The general solution to a linear differential equation is the sum of the complementary function (the general solution to the associated homogeneous equation) and a particular integral (any solution to the nonhomogeneous equation).

The method of solving a linear differential equation depends on the order of the equation and the form of the coefficient functions $a_i(x)$ and the source term $g(x)$. For first order linear differential equations, an integrating factor can be used. For higher order equations, methods such as the method of undetermined coefficients or variation of parameters can be used.

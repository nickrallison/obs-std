# Lead-Lag Controller

A controller typically used to nudge the transfer functions of existing controllers without majorly changing the dynamics.

A Lead-Lag Controller is a type of control system used in various engineering applications to improve the performance of a system. It is designed to either advance (lead) or delay (lag) the phase of a signal in order to achieve desired system response. The lead controller can increase the speed of the transient response and improve system stability, while the lag controller can reduce steady-state error. These controllers are often used together in systems where both transient and steady-state performance need to be improved.

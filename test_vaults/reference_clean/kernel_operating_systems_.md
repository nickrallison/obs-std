# Kernel (Operating Systems)

A kernel is a fundamental part of an operating system. It is the core program that controls all other programs in a computer system. It manages the system's resources, such as memory, processor time, and disk space, and handles input and output requests from software, translating them into data-processing instructions for the central processing unit (CPU). The kernel also manages security, file systems, network communications, and system startup.

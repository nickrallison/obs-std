# Proportional Controllers

Proportional Controllers, also known as Proportional Controllers, are a type of feedback controller used in control systems to maintain the desired output of a system. They work by calculating an error value as the difference between a desired setpoint and the actual system output. This error value is then multiplied by a proportional gain constant to determine the control action. The controller aims to minimize this error over time, thus bringing the system's output closer to the desired setpoint. However, Proportional Controllers may not always eliminate all errors and may result in a steady-state error. They are commonly used in various engineering fields such as process control, robotics, and automation.

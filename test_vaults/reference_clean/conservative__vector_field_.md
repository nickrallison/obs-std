# Conservative (vector field)

A conservative vector field is a special type of vector field that is path-independent. This means that the work done by the field in moving a particle from one point to another is path independent. In other words, the work done only depends on the initial and final positions of the particle, not on the specific route the particle took. This property is a result of the field's curl being zero. Examples of conservative vector fields include gravitational fields and electrostatic fields.

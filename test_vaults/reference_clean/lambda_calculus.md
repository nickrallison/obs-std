# Lambda Calculus

Lambda Calculus is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. It is a universal model of computation that can be used to simulate any Turing machine. It was introduced by mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of his research into the foundations of mathematics. Lambda Calculus has applications in many areas, including computer science, where it serves as the theoretical foundation for programming languages and is used in areas such as functional programming, type systems and compiler design.

The prompt does not provide a specific formula related to Lambda Calculus to be written in LaTeX format. However, the basic notation for a lambda function can be written as follows:

$$
\begin{gather*} 
\lambda x . f(x)
\end{gather*}
$$

Here, $\lambda x$ denotes a function with argument $x$, and $f(x)$ is the body of the function.

# Voltage Controlled Oscillator

A Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) is an electronic device that produces oscillations (waveforms) whose frequency is determined by the voltage input. The output frequency can be changed dynamically by varying the input voltage. VCOs are commonly used in synthesizers, telecommunication systems, and other electronic devices to generate signals used for various purposes such as conveying information or controlling processes.

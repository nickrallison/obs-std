# Martingale Betting Strategy

The Martingale betting system is a strategy commonly used in games of chance such as roulette or blackjack. It is based on the principle of doubling your bet after each loss, so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake. The idea is that a win is inevitable in the long run, therefore recouping all losses. However, this system requires a large amount of capital and carries a high risk, as repeated losses can deplete one's bankroll quickly. It also operates under the assumption that there is no limit to how much one can bet, which isn't true in most gambling scenarios.

The expected value of a betting strategy known as the Martingale strategy is often misunderstood by many gamblers. The expected value of the Martingale betting strategy is actually zero. This is because while it is true that you will eventually win, the amount you stand to lose increases exponentially with each loss. Therefore, the potential winnings from this strategy are offset by the potential losses.

# Expected Value

Expected value is a statistical concept that calculates the average outcome when an experiment is conducted numerous times. It is a key concept in probability and statistics, often used in decision-making processes, risk management, pricing models, and investment strategies. The expected value is calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by the probability of that outcome occurring, and then summing these values. It provides a weighted average of the possible outcomes of a random variable, giving a measure of central tendency, or expected result.

# Invertability

"Invertibility" is a term used in mathematics and linear algebra to describe a property of certain functions or matrices. If an object (like a matrix or function) is invertible, it means there exists another object that can reverse its effect when applied sequentially. For instance, if a function f(x) is invertible, there exists a function g(x) such that applying f and then g (or vice versa) will yield the original input. Similarly, an invertible matrix has an inverse matrix; when both are multiplied together, they produce the identity matrix. Invertibility is crucial in solving systems of equations and finding solutions to various mathematical problems. 

For a function f(x) to be invertible, there exists a function g(x) such that:
$$
f(g(x)) = x
$$
and 
$$
g(f(x)) = x
$$

Or stated another way, a function is invertible if it is Bijective.

For a matrix A to be invertible, there exists an inverse matrix A^{-1} such that:
$$
AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I
$$

Where I is the identity matrix.

## Invertability of Groups

In the context of group theory, a branch of mathematics, invertibility refers to the property of an element in a group to have an inverse. A group is a set of elements combined with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element. 

For an element 'a' in a group G, the inverse is denoted as 'a^-1'. This inverse has the property that when it is combined with 'a' using the group operation, the result is the Identity (Group Theory)|identity element of the Group (Group Theory)|group. The Identity (Group Theory)|identity element is a special type of element in a Group (Group Theory)|group that, when combined with any element of the Group (Group Theory)|group, doesn't change the value of that element.

For example, consider the Group (Group Theory)|group of integers under addition. The Identity (Group Theory)|identity element is 0 because adding 0 to any integer doesn't change its value. The inverse of any integer 'a' is '-a', because adding 'a' and '-a' together yields 0, which is the Identity (Group Theory)|identity.

So, in terms of groups, invertibility means that for every element in the group, there exists another element in the group such that when the two are combined via the group operation, they yield the identity element. This concept is fundamental to many areas of mathematics and its applications.

# L'Hopitals Rule

L'Hopital's Rule is a mathematical method used in calculus to find the limit of a quotient of two functions that approach zero or infinity. This rule states that if the limit of the ratio of two functions, as x approaches a certain value, results in an indeterminate form (0/0 or ∞/∞), then the limit of their derivatives can be taken instead. The rule is named after the French mathematician Guillaume de l'Hôpital. It provides a way to bypass such direct calculations which could result in undefined expressions.

Here is the relevant formula for L'Hopital's Rule:

$$
\lim_{{x \to c}} \frac{{f(x)}}{{g(x)}} = \lim_{{x \to c}} \frac{{f'(x)}}{{g'(x)}}
$$

if $\lim_{{x \to c}} f(x) = 0$ and $\lim_{{x \to c}} g(x) = 0$, or both limits are $\pm\infty$. 

Here, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are the derivatives of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ respectively. This rule can be applied repeatedly if the new ratio of derivatives still results in an indeterminate form.

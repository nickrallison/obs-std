# Fourier Series

The Fourier Series is a mathematical concept used to break down any periodic function into a set of simple oscillating functions, namely sines and cosines. Named after Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier, this series is particularly useful in solving problems related to heat conduction, vibrations, and acoustics. It's also widely used in signal processing and image analysis.

In essence, the Fourier Series allows us to represent complex waveforms as an infinite sum of simple sine and cosine waves. Each of these sine or cosine waves has a specific amplitude and phase shift that can be calculated using the Fourier coefficients. The ability to decompose a function into simpler parts makes it easier to analyze and manipulate in various fields of science and engineering.

The first use case of Fourier Series was by Fourier himself. He had derived it to find a simple solution to the Heat Equation. A 3 dimensional partial differential equation. Where a solution at a constant time T was found and could be used to find a general solution at any time t.

$$
f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} [a_n \cos(nx) + b_n \sin(nx)]
$$

where

$$
a_0 = \frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T} f(x) dx
$$

$$
a_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_{0}^{T} f(x) \cos(nx) dx
$$

$$
b_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_{0}^{T} f(x) \sin(nx) dx
$$

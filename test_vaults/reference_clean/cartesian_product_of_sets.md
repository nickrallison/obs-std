# Cartesian Product of Sets

The Cartesian product, named after René Descartes, is a mathematical operation that returns a set from multiple sets. If we have two sets, say A and B, the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as $A \times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. 

Formally, the Cartesian product of two sets A and B is defined as:

$$
A \times B = \{(a, b) | a \in A, b \in B\}
$$

This concept can be extended to more than two sets. The Cartesian product of n sets, denoted as $A_1 \times A_2 \times … \times A_n$, is the set of all ordered n-tuples where the i-th component of each n-tuple comes from the i-th set.

For example, if we have two sets A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}, the Cartesian product $A \times B$ would be {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}.

The Cartesian product is used in various areas of mathematics. In geometry, the Cartesian product of two sets of points gives a set of points in a plane. In computer science, the Cartesian product of sets is used to describe the possible states of a system.

The concept of Cartesian product is closely related to the concept of a relation. A relation from a set A to a set B is a subset of the Cartesian product $A \times B$.

# Axiom Of Determinacy

The Axiom of Determinacy (AD) is a principle from the field of set theory, a branch of mathematical logic. It is an alternative to the more commonly used Axiom of Choice. The AD asserts that in any game of perfect information involving two players, where moves are chosen from a countable set and play continues for an infinite number of moves, one player must have a winning strategy. However, this axiom contradicts the Axiom of Choice and cannot coexist with it in the standard Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory. The Axiom of Determinacy is often used in descriptive set theory to produce more intuitive results.

## Simple Explanation

The Axiom of Determinacy is a rule stating that in a certain type of infinite game (Gale Stewart Game), one player always has a winning strategy.

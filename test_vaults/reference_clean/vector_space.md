# Vector Space

A vector space, also known as a linear space, is a fundamental concept in mathematics, particularly in the field of linear algebra. It is a collection of objects called vectors, which can be added together and multiplied by scalars (real or complex numbers). Vector spaces are subject to ten specific axioms, including commutativity, associativity, and distributivity of vector addition and scalar multiplication. Examples of vector spaces include sets of numbers, functions, polynomials, and matrices. They are used in various fields such as physics, computer science, and engineering for modeling phenomena and solving problems.

## Axioms

The axioms of a vector space are the rules that define how these operations of addition and scalar multiplication behave. These axioms are the basic properties that all vector spaces must satisfy. They are the foundation upon which the entire theory of vector spaces is built.

There are eight axioms in total. Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. Associativity of Addition: This axiom states that the way vectors are grouped in an addition operation doesn't change the result. In other words, if you have three vectors a, b, and c, then (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).

2. Commutativity of Addition: This axiom states that the order in which vectors are added doesn't change the result. So, for any two vectors a and b, a + b = b + a.

3. Identity Element of Addition: This axiom states that there exists an element 0 in the vector space such that for every vector v, v + 0 = v.

4. Inverse Elements of Addition: This axiom states that for every vector v, there exists an element -v such that v + (-v) = 0.

5. Compatibility of Scalar Multiplication with Field Multiplication: This axiom states that for any two scalars a and b and any vector v, a * (b * v) = (a * b) * v.

6. Identity Element of Scalar Multiplication: This axiom states that for every vector v, 1 * v = v where 1 is the multiplicative Identity (Group Theory)|identity in the field.

7. Distributivity of Scalar Multiplication with respect to Vector Addition: This axiom states that for any scalar a and any vectors u and v, a * (u + v) = a * u + a * v.

8. Distributivity of Scalar Multiplication with respect to Scalar Addition: This axiom states that for any scalars a and b and any vector v, (a + b) * v = a * v + b * v.

These axioms provide the structure needed to study concepts such as linear combinations, linear independence, basis, dimension, linear transformations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors in more advanced topics in linear algebra.

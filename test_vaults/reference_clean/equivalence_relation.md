# Equivalence Relation

An equivalence relation is a type of binary relation on a set that satisfies three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. These properties are defined as follows:

1. **[[Reflexive Relation.md|Reflexivity]]**: For all $x$ in the set, $x$ is related to itself. Formally, this is written as $xRx$ for all $x$ in the set.

2. **[[Symmetric Relation.md|Symmetry]]**: For all $x$ and $y$ in the set, if $x$ is related to $y$, then $y$ is related to $x$. Formally, this is written as $xRy$ implies $yRx$.

3. **[[Transitive Relation.md|Transitivity]]**: For all $x$, $y$, and $z$ in the set, if $x$ is related to $y$ and $y$ is related to $z$, then $x$ is related to $z$. Formally, this is written as $xRy$ and $yRz$ implies $xRz$.

An example of an equivalence relation is the "is equal to" relation on the set of integers. For any integer $x$, $x$ is equal to itself (reflexivity), if $x$ is equal to $y$ then $y$ is equal to $x$ (symmetry), and if $x$ is equal to $y$ and $y$ is equal to $z$, then $x$ is equal to $z$ (transitivity).

Equivalence relations are important in many areas of mathematics. For example, they are used to define equivalence classes, which are subsets of the set on which the equivalence relation is defined. Each equivalence class consists of all elements that are related to each other. In the example of the "is equal to" relation on the set of integers, each equivalence class consists of a single integer, since each integer is only equal to itself.

Equivalence relations are also used in the definition of quotient spaces in topology and algebra. A quotient space is a type of "factor" space that is obtained by "collapsing" all the elements of each equivalence class to a single point.

# LTI System Stability

Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system stability is a concept in signal processing and control theory. It refers to the ability of a system to produce bounded output for a given bounded input. In other words, a stable LTI system doesn't amplify the input signal's magnitude and doesn't generate an output if there's no input. 

Stability can be determined through various methods such as Bode plots, Nyquist plots, or evaluating the roots of the system's characteristic equation. In particular, if all poles of an LTI system lie in the left half of the complex plane (for continuous-time systems) or inside the unit circle (for discrete-time systems), then the system is considered stable. 

Understanding LTI system stability is crucial in many fields including electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and economics because it helps determine whether a given system will behave as expected or potentially fail.

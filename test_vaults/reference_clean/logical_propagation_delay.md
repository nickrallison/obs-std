# Logical Propagation Delay

Logical propagation delay refers to the amount of time it takes for a change in input of a logic gate to produce a change in output. It is a crucial factor in digital circuits, affecting the speed at which data can be processed. The delay is caused by the time it takes for electrical signals to travel through the components of the circuit. Reducing logical propagation delay can improve the performance and efficiency of digital systems.

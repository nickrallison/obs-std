# Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory

Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, also known as ZF, is a formal system in mathematical logic that provides the foundation for most of mathematics. It defines the basic concepts and principles of set theory, including the notions of membership, equality, subset, power set, union and intersection. The system is named after Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel who developed it in the early 20th century. It's based on eight axioms that avoid paradoxes associated with naive set theory. These axioms include extensionality, regularity, schema of specification, pairing, union, power set, infinity and axiom of replacement. An extended version called ZFC includes an additional axiom known as the axiom of choice.

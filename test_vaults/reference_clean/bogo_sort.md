# Bogo Sort

Bogo Sort, also known as permutation sort, stupid sort, or slowsort, is a highly inefficient sorting algorithm based on the generate and test paradigm. It works by generating randomized permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted. The algorithm repeatedly shuffles the array randomly until the array is sorted. It is not useful for sorting large arrays due to its poor performance, with an average time complexity of O((n+1)!), making it one of the least efficient sorting algorithms.

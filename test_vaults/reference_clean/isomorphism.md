# Isomorphism

In mathematics, isomorphism (The identity morphism) refers to a transformation between two structures that preserves their form and relationships. It is a concept used in various branches of mathematics such as algebra, graph theory, and topology. Essentially, if two mathematical structures are isomorphic, they are identical in terms of their structure and properties, even though they may appear different superficially. This concept allows mathematicians to understand the inherent similarities between different mathematical systems.

# Kernel Functions

Kernel functions are a crucial part of many machine learning algorithms, particularly in support vector machines (SVMs). They are used to transform input data into a higher-dimensional space where it is easier to perform classifications or regressions. Essentially, kernel functions allow complex, non-linear relationships to be captured by the model. There are several types of kernel functions, including linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid. The choice of kernel functions can significantly impact the performance of the machine learning model.

# Normal Distribution

The Normal Distribution, also known as Gaussian distribution, is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. It is one of the most important probability distributions in statistics due to its numerous beneficial properties. The distribution is symmetric and its mean, median and mode are equal. It is characterised by its bell-shaped curve where the data points are concentrated around the peak which represents the highest probability. The shape of the normal distribution depends on the mean and the standard deviation. The standard deviation determines how much variation there is from the mean or expected value. Larger standard deviations lead to more spread out distributions. Normal distributions are commonly used in natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known or cannot be easily determined from data.

The formula for a Normal Distribution is given by:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{ -\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

where:
- $x$ is the variable.
- $\mu$ is the mean or expected value of the distribution.
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.
- $f(x)$ gives the probability density at point $x$.
- $e$ is Euler's number, a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828.

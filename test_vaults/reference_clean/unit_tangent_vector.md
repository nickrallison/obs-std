# Unit Tangent Vector

The unit tangent vector is a concept used in vector valued functions, primarily in calculus and physics. It is a vector that is tangent to a curve at a given point and has a magnitude of one. This vector is often used to describe the direction of a curve at a certain point. The unit tangent vector is calculated by taking the derivative of the vector valued function, which represents the curve, and then normalizing it (dividing it by its magnitude) to make its length equal to one. This concept is fundamental in understanding motion along a curve, curvature, and other aspects of differential geometry.

Sure, the formula for calculating the unit tangent vector $\mathbf{T}$ of a vector-valued function $\mathbf{r}(t)$ is given by:

$$
\mathbf{T}(t) = \frac{\mathbf{r}'(t)}{||\mathbf{r}'(t)||}
$$

Here, $\mathbf{r}'(t)$ is the derivative of the vector valued function and $||\mathbf{r}'(t)||$ is its magnitude.

# Euler Angles

Euler angles are a set of three angles that describe the orientation of a rigid body in a three-dimensional space. Named after Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, these angles provide a way to represent the rotation of an object using three numbers. The three angles are typically denoted as φ (phi), θ (theta), and ψ (psi). The order of these rotations can vary, leading to different sets of Euler angles. They are commonly used in physics, engineering, computer graphics, and robotics to describe the orientation of an object in space.

Euler angles come with the problem of Gimbal Lock, where when at a certain orientation, a degree of freedom is lost and movement is constrained. A more common approach to representing rotation in 3D space is Quaternions where this problem is avoided.

# Divergence Theorem

The Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem, is a fundamental theorem in vector calculus that relates the flux of a vector field through a closed surface to the divergence of the field in the volume enclosed by the surface. 

The theorem is formally stated as follows:

$$
\int\int\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) \, dV = \int\int_S \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S}
$$

where:
- $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}$ is the divergence of the vector field $\mathbf{F}$,
- $dV$ is an infinitesimal volume element in the volume $V$,
- $\mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S}$ is the flux of $\mathbf{F}$ across an infinitesimal area element $d\mathbf{S}$ of the closed surface $S$ bounding $V$,
- The left-hand side is a triple integral over the volume $V$,
- The right-hand side is a surface integral over the surface $S$.

The Divergence Theorem is a special case of the more general Stokes' Theorem, which relates a surface integral of a vector field to a line integral around the boundary of the surface.

The proof of the Divergence Theorem is typically done in Cartesian coordinates, and it involves showing the theorem is true for a tiny cube and then extending it to arbitrary volumes by partitioning them into tiny cubes. The proof is quite involved and requires a solid understanding of multivariable calculus.

Tangentially related items include other theorems in vector calculus such as Green's Theorem and Stokes' Theorem, as well as the concept of divergence and its geometric interpretation as the rate at which "density" exits a region.

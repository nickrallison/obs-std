# Hash Function

A hash function is a special type of function used in computing to map data of arbitrary size to fixed size values. These values are often used to index data, detect duplicate data, or create identifiers for data. The output of a hash function, known as a hash code or simply hash, is typically a string of characters. The main characteristic of a good hash function is that it generates unique and consistent output for unique input values. However, two different inputs may sometimes produce the same output, an occurrence known as a collision. Hash functions are widely used in various fields such as cryptography, data retrieval, and error detection.

# Ternary Operator

## Ternary Operator Code

The ternary operator is a conditional operator in programming that provides a shorter syntax for the if-else statement. It takes three operands: a condition to check, a result for true case, and a result for false case. It's often used to simplify conditional assignments and expressions. The syntax typically looks like this: condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false. If the condition is true, the operator returns the value_if_true, otherwise it returns the value_if_false.

```C
// Example in C
int age = 15;
char* beverage = (age >= 21) ? "Beer" : "Juice";
printf("beverage: %s", beverage); // Output: Juice
```

## Ternary Operator Digital Circuit

A ternary operator digital circuit can be implemented using multiplexers. A multiplexer is a combinational digital circuit that selects binary information from one of many input lines and directs it to a single output line. The selection is controlled by a set of selection lines, also known as select inputs.

Here is how you can create a ternary operator digital circuit using a 2x1 multiplexer:

1. Create two input lines for the two possible results (value_if_true and value_if_false).

2. Create one selection line for the condition.

3. Connect the outputs of the input lines to the inputs of the multiplexer.

4. Connect the output of the condition to the selection input of the multiplexer.

5. The output of the multiplexer is now your result.

This way, depending on whether your condition is true or false, either value_if_true or value_if_false will be selected and directed to your output.

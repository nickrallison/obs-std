# Planar Graph

A planar graph is a type of graph in mathematical and computer science contexts that can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing each other. In other words, it's a graph that can be embedded in the plane. This concept is crucial in areas such as topology, and it's used to solve problems related to network design, coding theory, and map coloring. 

The most famous theorem related to planar graphs is Kuratowski's theorem which states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph homeomorphic to K5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K3,3 (the complete bipartite graph on six vertices, three of which connect to each of the other three). 

In addition, the Four Color Theorem states that any map in a plane can be colored using four-colors in such a way that regions sharing a common boundary do not share the same color. This theorem was one of the first major proven results using computer assistance.

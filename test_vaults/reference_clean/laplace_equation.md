# Laplace Equation

The Laplace Equation is a second-order partial differential equation named after Pierre-Simon Laplace, a French mathematician. It is the simplest example of elliptic partial differential equations. The general theory of solutions to Laplace's equation is known as potential theory. The solutions of Laplace's equation are the harmonic functions, which are important in many fields of science, notably the fields of physics, engineering, and mathematics. The Laplace Equation often describes steady-state scenarios in physical systems, such as heat conduction, fluid flow, and electromagnetic fields.

These differential equations can also be described as the set of functions $\phi$ such that when the Laplacian Operator is applied, the function is 0 everywhere

The Laplace equation in Cartesian coordinates can be written as follows:

$$
\begin{gather*} 
\nabla^2 \phi = \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial z^2} = 0
\end{gather*}
$$

Here, $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian Operator and $\phi$ is a scalar function.

# Linear Time Invariant Systems

Linear Time Invariant (LTI) Systems are a class of systems in signal processing and control systems that are both linear and time-invariant. Linearity means that the output of the system is directly proportional to the input. Time-invariance means that the properties of the system do not change over time. This makes LTI systems easier to analyze and implement, as their output can be predicted accurately using mathematical models. They are often used in fields such as telecommunications, electronics, and signal processing.

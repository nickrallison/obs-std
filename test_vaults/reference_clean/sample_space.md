# Sample Space

Sample space in probability and statistics refers to the total set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. It is usually represented by the Greek letter omega (Î©). For example, in a coin toss experiment, the sample space would be {Heads, Tails} because these are the only possible outcomes. The size or number of elements in a sample space can greatly affect the probability of an event. Understanding the concept of sample space is crucial for calculating probabilities and predicting outcomes in various fields such as mathematics, physics, finance, and more.

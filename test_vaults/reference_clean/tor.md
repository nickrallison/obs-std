# Tor

Tor, an abbreviation for "The Onion Router", is an open-source software that allows anonymous communication on the internet. It is designed to prevent tracking of user data and browsing history by routing online traffic through a worldwide network of servers. Its purpose is to protect personal privacy, keep internet activities confidential, and allow users to bypass censorship. Users can access websites without their location or other data being traceable. Tor is often used by activists, journalists, and those living under oppressive regimes to maintain their online privacy and freedom.

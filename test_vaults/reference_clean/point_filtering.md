# Point Filtering

Point filtering, also known as point operations or pixel operations, is a fundamental concept in image processing. It involves modifying the pixel values of an image based on a certain rule or function, applied independently to each pixel. This operation is often used for tasks such as contrast enhancement, brightness adjustment, thresholding, and color transformations.

The general formula for point filtering can be expressed as:

$$
g(x, y) = T[f(x, y)]
$$

where $f(x, y)$ is the original image, $g(x, y)$ is the processed image, and $T$ is the transformation function applied to each pixel.

One of the simplest forms of point filtering is linear point filtering, where the transformation function is a linear function. This can be expressed as:

$$
T(f(x, y)) = a \cdot f(x, y) + b
$$

where $a$ and $b$ are constants. This operation can be used to adjust the brightness and contrast of an image.

Another common form of point filtering is thresholding, where the transformation function is a step function. This can be expressed as:

$$
T(f(x, y)) = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } f(x, y) \geq T \\
0 & \text{if } f(x, y) < T 
\end{cases}
$$

where $T$ is the threshold value. This operation is often used for image binarization.

Point filtering is different from other image processing operations such as convolution and morphological operations, which take into account the values of neighboring pixels. However, these operations can often be combined to achieve more complex image processing tasks.

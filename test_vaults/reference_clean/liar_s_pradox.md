# Liar’s Pradox

The Liar’s Paradox is a statement that says "this statement is false." It's a paradox because if the statement is true, then it must be false as stated. However, if it's false, then it contradicts itself by being true. This creates an endless loop of contradiction. It's often used in philosophical and mathematical discussions to demonstrate the complex nature of truth and self-reference.

# Strong Induction

Strong induction, also known as complete induction or course-of-values induction, is a method of mathematical proof used to establish the validity of a given proposition for all natural numbers. It extends the principle of ordinary mathematical induction by making the inductive step depend not just on one predecessor but on all predecessors. This means that in proving a statement for a particular number, it assumes that the statement is true for all numbers less than it. Strong induction is commonly used in more complex proofs where each step depends on multiple previous steps.

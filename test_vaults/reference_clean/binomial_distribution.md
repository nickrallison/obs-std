# Binomial Distribution

The Binomial Distribution is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory. It describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (experiments) with the same probability of success.

For example, if you were to flip a coin 10 times, the binomial distribution could tell you the probability of getting exactly 6 heads. The distribution is determined by two parameters: the number of trials ($n$) and the probability of success on each trial ($p$).

The binomial distribution has several key properties. It's discrete, meaning it only takes on integer values. It's symmetric if the probability of success is 0.5, but skews towards high or low values as that probability changes. The mean (average value) of a binomial distribution is $\mu = np$, and its variance (measure of spread) is $\sigma^2 = np(1-p)$.

Binomial distributions are widely used in quality control, forecasting, survey sampling, and many other areas where it's useful to know the likelihood of different outcomes for a set number of trials with two possible outcomes.

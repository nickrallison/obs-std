# Epsilon Delta Definition of Limits

The Epsilon-Delta definition of limits is a formal mathematical concept used in calculus to define the limit of a function at a particular point. According to this definition, for every small positive number epsilon (ε), there exists a positive number delta (δ) such that if the distance between x and a certain point is less than delta, then the absolute difference between f(x) and the limit is less than epsilon. This definition provides a precise way to handle the concept of limits, especially when dealing with infinitesimals or points of discontinuity.

Sure, the epsilon-delta definition of a limit is typically written as follows:

$$
\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, |x - a| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - L| < \epsilon
$$

Where:

- $|x - a| < \delta$ is the distance between x and a certain point being less than delta.
- $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$ is the absolute difference between f(x) and the limit (L) being less than epsilon.

# Standard Deviation

Standard Deviation is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (average) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range. It is commonly used in statistics and data analysis to understand the distribution of data points. The standard deviation is especially useful because it is expressed in the same units as the original data, which makes it easy to interpret. It's also important in fields like finance, where it's used to measure market volatility and risk associated with certain investments.

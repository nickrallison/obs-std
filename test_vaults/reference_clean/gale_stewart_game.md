# Gale Stewart Game

The Gale Stewart Game is a concept in game theory and mathematical logic, where two players take turns to choose elements from a set. The game continues indefinitely and the player who builds an infinite sequence with a specific property wins. The Axiom of Determinacy states that one person in this game is guaranteed to have a winning strategy.

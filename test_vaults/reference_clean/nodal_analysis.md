# Nodal Analysis

Nodal analysis is a method used in electrical engineering to determine the voltage distribution within an electrical circuit. It involves applying Kirchhoffâ€™s current law to find unknown voltages in a network of elements such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors. The method simplifies the process of analyzing complex circuits by reducing the number of equations that need to be solved simultaneously. Nodal analysis is particularly useful for circuits with many components and nodes, providing a systematic way to solve for all unknown voltages.

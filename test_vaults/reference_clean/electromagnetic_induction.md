# Electromagnetic-Induction

Electromagnetic-induction is a fundamental principle in physics that describes how a magnetic field can generate an electric current. This phenomenon was first discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831. It is based on Faradays law of electromagnetic-induction, which states that the induced electromotive force (or voltage) in any closed circuit is equal to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the circuit. This principle is used in many practical applications such as transformers, electric generators, and electrical-induction motors.

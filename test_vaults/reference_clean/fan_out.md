# Fan Out

"Fan Out" refers to the maximum number of digital inputs that a single output can drive. In computer science, it's used in similar context to denote the number of other objects or operations an object can affect or be connected to. The term helps in understanding and managing the complexity and efficiency of a system.

This concept is used extensively in digital electronics to determine the ability of a logic gate to drive other logic gates, where each gate represents an input or output point. The fan out of a system or component is important because it directly impacts the speed and reliability of signal transmission.

For example, a digital logic gate as some output capacitance, meaning it stores some amount of charge. The more outputs that gate is driving, the more work that small amount of charge has to do. So a large fanout, in general will mean a larger propagation delay

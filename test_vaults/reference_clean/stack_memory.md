# Stack Memory

Stack memory in computer architecture refers to a specific area of a computer's RAM (Random Access Memory) that is used for temporary storage of data. It operates in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner, meaning the most recently stored data is the first to be retrieved. Stack memory is used for static memory allocation, and it's primarily involved in function call management within a program. It's faster to allocate in comparison to heap memory, but it's also limited in size. If a program exceeds the stack capacity, it will result in a stack overflow error.

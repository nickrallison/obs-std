# Metatheory of Truth Functional Language

The Metatheory of Truth Functional Language refers to the study and analysis of the principles, concepts, and logical structure of truth-functional languages. These are languages where the truth-values of sentences are determined solely by the truth-values of their parts. This metatheory explores how these languages function, their syntax and semantics, and how truth values are assigned and manipulated within them. It is a crucial aspect of logic and philosophy, helping to understand the nature of truth and logical reasoning in formal languages.

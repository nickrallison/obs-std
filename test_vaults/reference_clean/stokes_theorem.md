# Stokesâ€™ Theorem

Stokes' Theorem is a fundamental principle in vector calculus that relates the flow of a vector field across a surface to the behavior of the vector field along the boundary of the surface. It is named after British mathematician Sir George Gabriel Stokes. The theorem is used in various fields such as physics and engineering to solve problems involving fluid flow, electromagnetism, and more. It essentially states that the integral of a differential form over the boundary of a manifold equals the integral of its exterior derivative over the whole manifold.

The Stokes' theorem is typically presented as follows:

$$
\begin{gather*}
\int_{\partial \Omega} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \iint_{\Omega} (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot d\mathbf{A}
\end{gather*}
$$

Where $\partial \Omega$ represents the boundary of the surface $\Omega$, $\mathbf{F}$ is a vector field, $d\mathbf{r}$ is a differential length element along the boundary, and $(\nabla \times \mathbf{F})$ is the curl of the vector field.

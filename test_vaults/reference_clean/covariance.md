# Covariance

Covariance is a statistical concept that measures the degree to which two variables change in relation to each other. It is used to gauge how much two random variables vary together. If the covariance is positive, it indicates that the two variables tend to increase or decrease together. If it's negative, it means the variables move in opposite directions. If the covariance is zero, it suggests that the variables are independent of each other. Covariance provides a sense of the direction of the relationship between two variables but does not provide information about its strength or magnitude.

Cov(X, Y) = E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])]

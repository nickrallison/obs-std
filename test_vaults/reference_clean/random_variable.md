# Random Variable

A **random variable** is a variable whose possible values are numerical outcomes of a random phenomenon. There are two types of random variables, discrete and continuous.

A **discrete random variable** is one which may take on only a countable number of distinct values such as 0,1,2,3,4,â€¦ etc. Examples might be the number of heads you get when flipping three coins, or the number of defective light bulbs in a box of ten.

A **[[Continuity.md|continuous]] random variable** is one which takes an infinite number of possible values. For example, you could define a random variable X to be the height of students in a class. Since height is a continuous measurement, X is a continuous random variable.

The **probability distribution** of a random variable is a function that describes the likelihood of each possible outcome. For discrete random variables, this is often represented as a probability mass function (PMF), while for continuous random variables, it is represented as a probability density function (PDF).

The **[[Expected Value.md|expected value]]** (or mean) of a random variable is the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents. For a discrete random variable, the expected value is calculated by summing the product of each outcome and its probability. For a continuous random variable, it's the integral of the product of each outcome and its probability density. The formula for the expected value of a discrete random variable $X$ is:

$$
E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i P(X = x_i)
$$

where $x_i$ are the possible outcomes and $P(X = x_i)$ is the probability of each outcome.

The **[[Variance.md|variance]]** of a random variable is a measure of how much values differ from the expected value. The formula for the variance of a random variable $X$ is:

$$
Var[X] = E[(X - E[X])^2] = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2
$$

The **[[Standard Deviation.md|standard deviation]]** is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of the average distance between the values of the random variable and the expected value.

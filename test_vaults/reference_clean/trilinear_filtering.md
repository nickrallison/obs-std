# Trilinear Filtering

Trilinear Filtering is a technique used in computer graphics to improve the quality of textures displayed on 3D models. This method involves linear interpolation of texture maps, which are applied to 3D surfaces to create more realistic rendering. Trilinear filtering uses three axes for interpolation, and combines two Mipmaps (pre-calculated, optimized sequences of textures) for a smoother transition between different levels of detail. It reduces the blocky appearance of magnified textures, providing a more detailed and realistic visual experience in video games and other 3D applications.

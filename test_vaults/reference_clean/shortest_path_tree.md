# Shortest Path Tree

The Shortest Path Tree (SPT) is a concept used in network routing protocols and graph theory. It is a tree that highlights the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph. The SPT is determined using algorithms such as Dijkstras algorithm and the Bellman-Ford algorithm. Each path in the tree represents the shortest possible way from the source to a given vertex. It is a useful tool for optimizing network data routing and solving a variety of graph theory problems.

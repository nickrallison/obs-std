# LRU Caching

LRU Caching, or Least Recently Used Caching, is a type of caching algorithm that keeps track of what items are used and how often. It removes the least recently used items first when the cache memory is full. This method is easy to implement and efficient in terms of complexity, making it a popular choice for cache replacement algorithms. LRU Caching is commonly used in various computing applications to speed up data retrieval processes by storing frequently accessed data in a cache.

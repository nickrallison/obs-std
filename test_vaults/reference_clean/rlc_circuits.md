# RLC Circuits

RLC circuits, also known as tuned circuits, are electric circuits consisting of a resistor (R), inductor (L), and capacitor (C), connected in series or parallel. This circuit is used to filter a signal by frequency. The name of the circuit is derived from the letters that are used to denote the three components of this circuit, where R stands for resistance, L for inductance, and C for capacitance.

The behavior of an RLC circuit is governed by its resonant frequency, which is determined by the values of R, L, and C. At resonance, the impedance of the circuit is at its minimum and the current is at its maximum. These circuits can function as oscillators, filters, tuners and frequency mixers.

RLC circuits have many applications in electronics including radio receivers and transmitters, audio systems, power supplies and digital logic systems.

# Atomic Types

Atomic types refer to types of variables that operations, such as assignment, read, or write, can be performed on atomically. This means that such operations are indivisible and uninterrupted (usually done in a single clock cycle), ensuring data integrity even in the presence of concurrent operations by multiple threads. Atomicity is crucial in multithreaded applications to prevent race conditions, where the outcome depends on the non-deterministic ordering of thread execution.

## Characteristics of Atomic Types

- **Indivisibility:** Atomic operations happen entirely or not at all, making them immune to thread interruption.
- **Visibility:** Changes made by an atomic operation in one thread are immediately visible to other threads, ensuring data consistency.
- **Lock-free:** Atomic types often achieve their atomicity without the use of locks, making operations on these types less likely to become bottlenecks in multithreaded applications.

## Common Atomic Operations

- **Load (read):** Acquires the value of an atomic variable.
- **Store (write):** Sets the value of an atomic variable.
- **Add, subtract, and others:** Performs arithmetic operations atomically.
- **Compare and swap (CAS):** A powerful atomic operation that updates a value only if it matches an expected previous value, often used to implement lock-free data structures and algorithms.

## Usage in Programming Languages

Different programming languages provide various mechanisms to work with atomic types:

- **C/C++:** The C11 and C++11 standards introduced the `<atomic>` header, offering atomic types (e.g., `std::atomic<int>`) and operations that guarantee atomicity.
- **Java:** Provides the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package, which includes atomic classes like `AtomicInteger` and `AtomicReference` for performing atomic operations.
- **Rust:** Rust emphasizes safety and concurrency, offering atomic types in the `std::sync::atomic` module, such as `AtomicIsize` and `AtomicBool`, ensuring operations are atomic across threads without data races.

## Benefits of Using Atomic Types

- **Concurrency Safety:** Atomic types are designed to be safe to share between threads without using locks, thereby avoiding common concurrency issues like race conditions.
- **Performance:** Since atomic types often avoid the overhead of locking mechanisms, they can offer better performance in some concurrent scenarios.
- **Simplification:** Using atomic types can simplify the development of concurrent applications by abstracting the complexity of ensuring operation atomicity.

## Considerations

- **Memory [[Ordering.md|Ordering]]:** When dealing with atomic types, especially in C++ with the `<atomic>` header, developers must be aware of different memory orderings (e.g., `memory_order_relaxed`, `memory_order_acquire`, `memory_order_release`). These orderings allow developers to fine-tune the synchronization between threads, trading off between strict data consistency and performance.
- **Overhead:** While often faster than lock-based concurrency, atomic operations can still carry more overhead than non-atomic operations. This factor should be considered when designing performance-critical code.

In summary, atomic types and operations play a vital role in the development of concurrent and multithreaded applications, offering a way to manage shared data safely and efficiently. Understanding and correctly applying atomic types is a critical skill for developers working on systems where data integrity and performance in concurrent environments are priorities.

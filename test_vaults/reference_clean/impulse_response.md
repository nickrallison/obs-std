# Impulse Response

Impulse response refers to a system's output when presented with a brief input signal, called an impulse (Dirac Delta Function). In other words, it is the reaction or response of any system (be it electrical, mechanical, or any other type) to an impulse input. This concept is particularly important in digital signal processing and system analysis, as it helps determine the stability and performance of a system. The impulse response can be used to calculate how the system will respond to more complex inputs.

Sure, the impulse response of a system is often denoted as $h(t)$ and is mathematically defined by the convolution integral:

$$
y(t) = (f * h)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau)h(t - \tau)d\tau
$$

Where:

- $y(t)$ represents the output signal,
- $f(\tau)$ represents the input signal, and
- $h(t - \tau)$ is the impulse response of the system.

In the context of digital signals, we usually deal with discrete time, which leads to a sum instead of an integral:

$$
y[n] = (f * h)[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} f[k]h[n - k]
$$

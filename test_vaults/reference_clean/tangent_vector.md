# Tangent Vector

A tangent vector is a vector that touches a curve at a single point and points in the direction of the curve's progression at that point. It is derived from vector-valued functions, which are functions that have vectors as their output. These functions are often used in physics to describe quantities that have both magnitude and direction, such as velocity or force. The tangent vector is crucial in calculus and physics as it provides information about the rate and direction of change of a function at a particular point.

Sure, the formula for the tangent vector to a curve given by a vector valued function $\overrightarrow{r}(t)$ is derived from its derivative as follows:
$$
\overrightarrow{r'}(t) = \frac{d\overrightarrow{r}}{dt}
$$

This vector $\overrightarrow{r'}(t)$ is the tangent vector at any point $t$ on the curve.

# Factor Theorem

The Factor Theorem is a special case of the Remainder Theorem, which is a fundamental theorem in algebra. It is used to factorize polynomials and find their roots.

The Factor Theorem states that a polynomial $f(x)$ has a factor $(x - c)$ if and only if $f(c) = 0$. In other words, if a given value $c$ is a root of the polynomial (i.e., it makes the polynomial equal to zero), then $(x - c)$ is a factor of that polynomial.

Let's consider a polynomial $f(x)$ and a number $c$. According to the Factor Theorem, if $f(c) = 0$, then $(x - c)$ is a factor of $f(x)$. This can be written as:

$$
f(x) = (x - c)g(x)
$$

where $g(x)$ is another polynomial.

The proof of the Factor Theorem is a direct application of the Remainder Theorem. The Remainder Theorem states that if a polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by $(x - c)$, then the remainder is $f(c)$. If $f(c) = 0$, then the remainder is zero, which means $(x - c)$ is a factor of $f(x)$.

The Factor Theorem is particularly useful when dealing with polynomial equations. It allows us to find the roots of the polynomial, which are the solutions to the equation $f(x) = 0$. Once we find one root, we can use polynomial division to simplify the polynomial and find the remaining roots.

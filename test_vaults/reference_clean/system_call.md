# System Call

A system call is a program's request for a service from the operating system's kernel. It provides an interface between a process and the operating system, allowing the process to interact with hardware or perform other specific tasks that only the kernel has sufficient privileges to execute. Examples of system calls include reading or writing to a file, creating new processes, and communicating over a network.

# Support Vector Machines

Support Vector Machines (SVM) are a type of supervised machine learning model used for classification and regression analysis. They are effective in high dimensional spaces and are versatile as different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. The main principle of SVM is to plot each data item in the dataset in an n-dimensional space (where n is the number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, SVM performs classification by finding the hyperplane that differentiates the two classes very well. SVMs are also capable of handling non-linear data by using a method called the kernel trick, transforming their input into high-dimensional feature spaces.

# Fermat's Factorization Method

Fermat's Factorization Method is a factorization algorithm and, as the name suggests, it was developed by Pierre de Fermat. It's based on the representation of an odd integer as the difference of two squares.

The general formula for the difference of two squares is $a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)$. Fermat's method exploits this identity to factorize a number $N$.

The method starts by finding a square number which is slightly larger than the number $N$ we want to factorize. We'll call this number $x^2$. Then, we calculate the difference between this square and $N$, which we'll call $y^2$. If $y^2$ is a perfect square, then we have found a factorization of $N$.

The steps of Fermat's Factorization Method are as follows:

1. Set $x$ to be the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\sqrt{N}$.
2. Compute $y^2 = x^2 - N$.
3. If $y$ is an integer, then $N$ is the difference of the two squares $x^2$ and $y^2$, and we have found a factorization of $N$: $N = (x+y)(x-y)$.
4. If $y$ is not an integer, increment $x$ by 1 and go back to step 2.

This method is particularly efficient when the number $N$ to be factorized has two factors that are close together. However, it can be very slow if the factors are far apart.

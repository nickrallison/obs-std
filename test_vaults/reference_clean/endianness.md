# Endianness

Endianness refers to the sequential order in which bytes are arranged into larger numerical values when stored in memory or during transmission. There are two types: big-endian and little-endian. Big-endian systems store the most significant byte of a word at the smallest memory address and the least significant byte at the largest. Little-endian systems, on the other hand, store the least significant byte at the smallest address. The concept of endianness is crucial in fields like data serialization, digital signal processing, and network protocols.

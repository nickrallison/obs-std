# Directed Graph

A directed graph, also known as a digraph, is a set of vertices and edges where all the edges are directed from one vertex to another. Each edge has an initial point (from where the edge starts) and a terminal point (where the edge ends). It is often used in computer science and mathematics to represent relations or processes. The direction of the edges can represent dependencies, flow direction, or any other type of asymmetric relationship. Examples of real-world applications include web page links, social media networks, and citation networks.

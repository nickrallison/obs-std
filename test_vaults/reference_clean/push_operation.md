# Push Operation

The "push" operation in computer science, specifically in the context of data structures like stacks and queues, involves adding an element to the collection. In a stack, it's typically added to the top and in a queue, it's added to the end. The push operation updates the size of the stack or queue, increasing it by one. Different data structures might perform this operation slightly differently, but the basic concept remains the same: inserting an element into the collection.

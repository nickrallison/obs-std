# Yablo's Paradox

Yablo's Paradox is a logical paradox which involves an infinite sequence of sentences, each stating that all following sentences are false. The paradox arises from the question of whether these sentences are true or false. It was introduced by philosopher Stephen Yablo in 1993 and is a variation on the well-known liar paradox, but without self-reference, as none of the sentences refer to themselves. The complexity of this paradox lies in its self-referential nature and its infinite regress, making it a significant topic in the philosophy of logic.

$S_1: \text{Every Statement After this one is false}\newline$  
$S_2: \text{Every Statement After this one is false}\newline$  
$S_3: \text{Every Statement After this one is false}\newline$  
$â€¦$

if $S_1$ is true, then both $S_2$ and $S_3$ must be false which leads to a contradiction.

If $S_1$ is false, then some sentence $S_n$ is true, meaning $S_{n+1}$ and $S_{n+2}$ are false which again is a contradiction

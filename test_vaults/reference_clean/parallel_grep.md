# Parallel Grep

**Parallel [[Grep.md|Grep]]** in the context of Linux refers to the method used to search for strings or patterns within files across the filesystem with the higher efficiency provided by executing multiple grep processes in parallel. This is particularly useful for large filesystems or when dealing with a huge number of files. By leveraging the capability of modern multi-core processors, grep operations that would normally take a significant amount of time can be executed more swiftly.

Here is the command to run grep in parallel:

```bash
find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -P 16 grep -P "PCRE_PATTERN"
```

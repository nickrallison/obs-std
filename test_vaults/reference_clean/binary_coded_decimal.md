# Binary Coded Decimal

Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) is a class of binary encodings of decimal numbers where each decimal digit is represented by a fixed number of bits, usually four or eight. It's a way to express decimal numbers in binary form, where the decimal digits 0-9 are represented by their binary equivalents ranging from 0000-1001.

The primary advantage of BCD is that it allows for easy conversion between binary and decimal for human interaction, and it also simplifies the process of decimal arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The BCD system works by assigning a four-digit binary code to each digit 0-9 in the decimal system. The codes are as follows:

```
0: 0000
1: 0001
2: 0010
3: 0011
4: 0100
5: 0101
6: 0110
7: 0111
8: 1000
9: 1001
```

For example, the decimal number 195 would be represented in BCD as follows:

```
1: 0001
9: 1001
5: 0101
```

So, 195 in BCD would be 0001 1001 0101.

BCD is used in a variety of applications, including calculators, digital clocks, and various systems where numerical data is input or output in a decimal format.

BCD is related to a number of other binary encodings of decimal numbers, including Excess-3 and Gray code. It's also related to binary number systems, which are used in virtually all digital computers and many other types of digital systems.

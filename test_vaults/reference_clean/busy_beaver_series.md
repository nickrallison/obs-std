The Busy Beaver Game is a concept in the field of computability theory within mathematics and computer science. The game involves designing a Turing machine (a mathematical model of computation) that performs the longest possible computation before it halts, given a specific number of states. The term "Busy Beaver" refers to this hypothetical Turing machine. The game was first introduced by mathematician Tibor Rad√≥ in 1962. It helps to explore what can be computed and has implications for the unsolvability problem in computer science.

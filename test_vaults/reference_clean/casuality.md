# Casuality

Causality in the context of LTI (Linear Time-Invariant) systems refers to the principle where the output at any time depends only on past and present inputs, but not on future inputs. A system is said to be causal if its current output is a function of current and past inputs only. This is a necessary condition for real-time processing systems. In terms of signal processing, causality ensures that the output signal does not respond before the input signal is applied. This principle has significant applications in engineering and physics.

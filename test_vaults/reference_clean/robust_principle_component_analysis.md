# Robust Principle Component Analysis

Robust Principle Component Analysis (RPCA) is a technique in multivariate statistics that extends Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It is used to decompose a data matrix into a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix. The low-rank matrix captures the main structure of the data, while the sparse matrix captures the outliers or anomalies.

The mathematical problem that RPCA solves can be formulated as follows:

Given a data matrix $M$, we want to find a low-rank matrix $L$ and a sparse matrix $S$ such that $M = L + S$.

This problem can be solved by minimizing the following objective function:

$$
\min_{L,S} ||L||_* + \lambda ||S||_1 \quad \text{subject to} \quad M = L + S
$$

where $||L||_*$ is the nuclear norm of $L$ (the sum of its singular values), $||S||_1$ is the $l_1$-norm of $S$ (the sum of the absolute values of its entries), and $\lambda$ is a regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between the low-rank and sparse components.

The above optimization problem can be solved using a method called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), which is an iterative algorithm that alternates between updating $L$ and $S$ until convergence.

For a more detailed explanation of the PCP algorithm and the theoretical guarantees of RPCA, you can refer to the following scholarly paper: "[Robust Principal Component Analysis?](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Robust+Principal+Component+Analysis%3F&btnG=)" by Emmanuel J.

# Disjunctive Normal Form

Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) is a way of structuring logical expressions using only disjunction (OR) and conjunction (AND) operators. A logical formula is in DNF if it is a disjunction of one or more conjunctions of literals, where a literal is a variable or the negation of a variable. In simpler terms, it's an OR of ANDs. For example, the expression (A AND B) OR (C AND D) is in Disjunctive Normal Form.

$$
(A \land B) \lor (C \land D)
$$

The minimal DNF can be found via a karnaugh map.

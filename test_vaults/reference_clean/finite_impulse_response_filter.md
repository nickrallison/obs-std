# Impulse Response Filter.md|Finite Impulse Response Filter]]

A Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter is a type of signal processing filter that is widely used in digital signal processing. It is characterized by its impulse response of finite duration, meaning it settles to zero in a finite amount of time. This type of filter uses a certain number of input points from the signal to calculate the output point, and once these points are used, they are discarded. FIR filters are stable and have linear phase characteristics, making them suitable for applications where phase distortion must be avoided.

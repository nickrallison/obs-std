# Process ID

A Process ID, often abbreviated as PID, is a unique identifying number that operating systems assign to each process running on a system. This number helps the system track and manage processes. It allows the system to control scheduling, execution, termination and resource allocation among processes. The PID is also used by system administrators for troubleshooting and system analysis.

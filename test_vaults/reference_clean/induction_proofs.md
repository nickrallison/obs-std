# Induction Proofs

Proof by induction is a mathematical technique used to prove a property or statement for a series of numbers. Here's the step-by-step approach to perform an induction proof:
1. **Base Case (Initialization):** Prove the statement is true for the initial value, usually where n=0 or n=1.
2. **Induction Hypothesis (Assumption):** Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k.
3. **Inductive Step:** Prove that if the statement holds for any given k, it must also hold for k+1.  
The key idea behind proof by induction is to show that if the property P(n) holds for one number n, then it also holds for the next number n+1. And since we've shown P(1) or P(0) is true during our base case, we can assert that P(n) is true for all positive integers. In simple terms, if you can get up one rung of a ladder (base case), and if being on any particular rung means you can reach the next one (inductive step), then you can climb as high as you want on this ladder (conclusion).
4. **Conclude the Proof**: State that the proof is completed by the induction, QED

# Transitive Relation

A transitive relation is a concept in mathematics, specifically in set theory and logic. It refers to a type of relationship between elements in a set. If we have three elements - A, B, and C - the relationship is transitive if when A is related to B, and B is related to C, then A is also related to C.

For example, if "A is greater than B" and "B is greater than C", it follows that "A is greater than C". This shows that the 'greater than' relation is transitive.

Transitivity can be applied in various fields such as computer science, linguistics, philosophy, and more. It's an important concept because it helps establish order and hierarchy among elements in a set or system.

\forall A, B, C : (A \subseteq B \land B \subseteq C) \rightarrow A \subseteq C

# Rooted Tree

A rooted tree is a special type of directed graph in mathematics and computer science that originates from a single node, known as the root. This tree structure is hierarchical, with each node (except the root) connected to exactly one parent node, and potentially many child nodes. The connections between nodes are referred to as edges. Rooted trees are used in various applications such as representing hierarchical relationships, organizing data, network structures, and algorithm design.

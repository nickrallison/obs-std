# Boid Simulation

A Boid simulation is a type of artificial life program that simulates the flocking behavior of birds. The term "boid" represents a bird-like object. It was created by Craig Reynolds in 1986 and is based on three basic rules: separation (avoid crowding neighbors), alignment (steer towards the average heading of neighbors), and cohesion (steer towards the average position of neighbors). This simulation has been used in computer graphics to generate realistic animations of flocks of birds, schools of fish, or herds of animals.

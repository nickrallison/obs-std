# ISO Files

ISO files, also known as ISO images, are archive files from an optical disc, such as a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray Disc. They are named after the ISO 9660 file system used with CD-ROM media, but can also contain a UDF (ISO/IEC 13346) file system. They are commonly used to distribute large programs and operating systems. Their most common use is to store a copy of an operating system for installation.

An ISO file contains the binary image of an entire disc's data, including the data content and the file system metadata, boot code, structures, and attributes. As such, it is an exact digital replica of the original source disc. 

The structure of an ISO file is defined by the ISO 9660 standard, which is a file system standard published by the International Organization for Standardization. It is designed to be platform-independent, allowing data interchange on different operating systems such as Windows, Mac, and Linux. 

The ISO 9660 standard defines a file system for read-only data CDs and includes provisions for information interchange between systems. It supports filenames up to 31 characters long, a maximum of 8 levels of directories, and file sizes up to 4 GB. 

The structure of an ISO 9660 file system is as follows:

1. **System Area**: The first 16 sectors, reserved for system use. It is often unused and filled with zeros.
2. **Volume Descriptor Set**: Describes the characteristics of the media, including volume attributes, file structure, and location of the root directory record.
3. **Directories and Files**: The actual content of the disc, organized in a hierarchical structure.
4. **Volume Descriptor Set Terminator**: Marks the end of the descriptor set.

The ISO file can also contain a bootable image that is loaded into memory during the boot process. This is commonly used for operating system installation discs.

ISO files can be created using disc imaging software, and can be opened, or 'mounted', as a virtual disc by operating system software. This makes the system treat the ISO file as if it were a physical disc.

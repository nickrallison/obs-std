# Universal Relation

The Universal Relation in logic is a concept that refers to a relation that holds between every pair of elements in a given set. In other words, it is a relation that is true for all possible combinations of elements. This concept is often used in mathematical logic and theoretical computer science, particularly in the study of relational databases and data structures. The universal relation is the opposite of the empty relation, which holds between no pairs of elements.

$$
\forall x \forall y A(x,y) \text{ is true}
$$

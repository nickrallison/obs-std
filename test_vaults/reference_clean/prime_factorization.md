# Prime Factorization

Prime factorization is a process in number theory, a branch of mathematics, where a number is expressed as a product of prime numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.

The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every integer greater than 1 either is a prime number itself or can be factorized as a product of prime numbers, and this factorization is unique, up to the order of the factors. This theorem is the theoretical basis for prime factorization.

The general process of prime factorization is as follows:

1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.
2. Divide the number to be factorized by 2. If the number is divisible by 2, write down 2 as one of the factors and repeat the process with the quotient.
3. If the number is not divisible by 2, try dividing by the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the process as above.
4. Continue this process with increasing prime numbers until the number to be factorized is reduced to 1.

For example, the prime factorization of 84 is $2^2 \times 3 \times 7$.

The prime factorization of a number has several applications in mathematics and computer science, such as in the calculation of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM), in cryptography, and in number theory.

The prime factorization of a number can be represented visually using a factor tree. A factor tree starts with the number to be factorized at the top and branches down to its prime factors.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer. It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2.

The prime factorization of a number can also be found using the Pollard's rho algorithm or the Quadratic Sieve, which are more efficient for large numbers.

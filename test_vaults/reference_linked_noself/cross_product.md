# Cross Product
The cross product, also known as the vector product, is a [[Binary Operation|binary operation]] on two vectors in three-dimensional space. It is denoted by the symbol Ã—. The cross product of two vectors results in another vector that is perpendicular (or orthogonal) to the plane containing the two original vectors.

The magnitude of the cross product is equal to the area of the parallelogram with sides equal to the two original vectors, and its direction follows the right-hand rule.

Cross products are commonly found in physics and engineering. They are used in mechanics to describe rotational motion, torque, and angular momentum; in electromagnetism to describe magnetic fields; and in computer graphics to calculate [[Unit Normal Vector|normal vectors]] or determine relative orientation of points

In general, Cross Products are non-communative and [[Distributivity|distributive]] over addition.

# Pointer

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. This allows for efficient handling of data, especially in large-scale software systems. Pointers are used for [[Dynamic Memory Allocation|dynamic memory allocation]], accessing array elements, passing arguments to functions, and building complex data structures like trees and graphs. They are a fundamental concept in languages such as C and C++.

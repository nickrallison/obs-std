# Well [[Ordering|Ordering]] Principle

The Well-Ordering Principle is a fundamental concept in number theory, stating that every non-empty set of positive integers has a least element. It is essentially the principle of mathematical [[Induction Proofs|induction]]. This principle is used to prove statements involving a set or subset of the positive integers. It's fundamental to various proofs in number theory and other branches of mathematics.

The Well-Ordering Principle does not have a particular formula or proof, as it is more of a foundational concept in mathematics. However, it can be stated formally as:

$$\forall S \subseteq \mathbb{N}, S \neq \emptyset, \exists m \in S: \forall x \in S, m \leq x $$

This states that for any non-empty subset of natural numbers, there exists a least element.

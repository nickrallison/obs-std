# Faradays Law

Faradays Law, named after scientist Michael Faraday, is a fundamental principle in electromagnetism that quantifies how a change in a magnetic field can generate an electric current. This phenomenon is known as [[Electromagnetic Induction|electromagnetic induction]].

The law states that the electromotive force (EMF) produced around a closed path or circuit is directly proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the area enclosed by the path. In simpler terms, if you have a coil of wire exposed to a changing magnetic field, an electric current will be induced in the wire.

This principle forms the basis for many technologies we use today, including electric generators and transformers.

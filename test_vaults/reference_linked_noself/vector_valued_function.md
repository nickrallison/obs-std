# Vector Valued Function

In calculus, a key aspect of studying vector valued functions (VVF) is examining their behavior through differentiation and integration. 

## Differentiation of Vector Valued Functions

The derivative of a vector valued function provides the rate of change of the vector output with respect to the input variable, typically time or another variable. If $\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle$ represents a VVF, its derivative is computed component-wise as:

$$
\mathbf{r}'(t) = \langle x'(t), y'(t), z'(t) \rangle
$$

This derivative is a vector that often represents physical quantities like velocity if the original function $\mathbf{r}(t)$ describes a position in space.

## Integration of Vector Valued Functions

Just as with differentiation, integration of vector valued functions is performed component-wise. The integral of a vector valued function over an interval gives the accumulated sum (or vector sum) of the vector components over that interval. For function $\mathbf{r}(t)$ as defined above, the integral is:

$$
\int_a^b \mathbf{r}(t) \, dt = \left\langle \int_a^b x(t) \, dt, \int_a^b y(t) \, dt, \int_a^b z(t) \, dt \right\rangle
$$

This integral can represent physical quantities like displacement, if the function $\mathbf{r}(t)$ represents velocity.

## Applications in Calculus

Vector valued functions are pivotal in several branches of calculus, including:

- **Calculus of Curves**: Here, $\mathbf{r}(t)$ can describe the position of a particle moving along a curve in three-dimensional space. Analysis of such curves involves computing tangents, normals, and curvature using vector derivatives.
- **Multivariable Calculus**: VVFs are essential in fields, flow lines, and surface mappings, where concepts like [[divergence.md|divergence]], [[curl.md|curl]], and [[gradient.md|gradient]] become important in describing the behavior of three-dimensional and vector fields.
- **Physics and Engineering**: In electromagnetism, fluid dynamics, and mechanics, vector calculus is used to model and solve problems regarding fields and forces.

## Example

Consider a particle moving along a space curve defined by $\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle t^2, \sin t, t \cos t \rangle$. Analysis of this particle's motion, including velocity, acceleration, and trajectory, can be handled by applying the principles of differentiation and integration of VVFs.

In video: as these procedures require a deep understanding of the fundamental concepts of calculus, frequent revisitation and application practice are recommended.

Understanding vector valued functions provides a crucial toolset for analyzing many physical and geometric phenomena, forming a foundational component in advanced mathematics and applied sciences.

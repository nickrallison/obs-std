# System of [[Differential Equations|Differential Equations]]

The prompt seems to be asking for a summary or explanation of a "System of [[Differential Equations|differential equations]] is a set of two or more equations]] involving derivatives of unknown functions. These systems are often used in mathematical modeling to describe dynamic systems, such as physical, biological, or economic systems. The solutions to these systems provide the functions that describe the behavior of the modeled system over time. Solving such systems can be complex and may require various methods including analytical solutions, numerical methods, or graphical methods.

Here is the latex format for a general system of [[Differential Equations|differential equations]]:

$$
\begin{gather*} 
\frac{dx_1}{dt} = f_1(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, t) \\
\frac{dx_2}{dt} = f_2(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, t) \\
\vdots \\
\frac{dx_n}{dt} = f_n(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, t)
\end{gather*}
$$

In this system of equations $x_i$ are the unknown functions and $f_i$ are given functions. The goal is to find $x_i(t)$ for $i=1,â€¦n$ that satisfy all equations in the system.

# [[virtual_address_space.md|Virtual Memory]] & DRM

[[virtual_address_space.md|Virtual Memory]] is a helpful component used to implement DRM. Protected Environments are implemented using page tables to ensure that the data is protected by the computer hardware itself. These protected environments act as a barrier, preventing unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive data. By leveraging [[virtual_address_space.md|virtual memory]], systems can enforce access controls that are tightly integrated with their memory management units (MMUs).

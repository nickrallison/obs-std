# Strong [[Induction Proofs|Induction]]

Strong [[Induction Proofs|induction]], also known as complete [[Induction Proofs|induction]] or course-of-values [[Induction Proofs|induction]], is a method of mathematical proof used to establish the validity of a given proposition for all natural numbers. It extends the principle of ordinary mathematical [[Induction Proofs|induction]] by making the inductive step depend not just on one predecessor but on all predecessors. This means that in proving a statement for a particular number, it assumes that the statement is true for all numbers less than it. Strong [[Induction Proofs|induction]] is commonly used in more complex proofs where each step depends on multiple previous steps.

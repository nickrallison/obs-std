# [[Contrapositive|Contrapositive]]

[[Contrapositive|Contrapositive]] refers to a type of logical argument or statement in which the original statement and its [[Contrapositive|contrapositive]] will always have the same truth value. It is formed by negating and reversing the hypothesis and conclusion of a statement. For example, if the original statement is "If it is raining, then I [[Amplitude Modulation|am]] inside," the [[Contrapositive|contrapositive]] would be "If I [[Amplitude Modulation|am]] not inside, then it is not raining." Both statements are logically equivalent.

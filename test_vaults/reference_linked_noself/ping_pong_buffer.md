# Ping Pong Buffer

**Expert**: Computer Scientist specializing in Data Structures and Algorithms  
**Objective**: To provide a comprehensive explanation of Ping Pong Buffer, including any tangentially related items, and relevant formulas, derivations, and proofs where applicable.  
**Assumptions**: You are seeking an in-depth understanding of the concept of Ping Pong Buffer, its applications, and related concepts in computer science.

A Ping Pong Buffer, also known as a double buffer, is a technique used in computer science to handle data processing and transfer. It involves two buffers, often referred to as the "front" and "back" buffers, or "ping" and "pong" buffers. The idea is to alternate between these two buffers for reading and writing operations, allowing one buffer to be used for reading while the other is being written to, and vice versa. This technique is particularly useful in real-time systems where data processing must continue without interruption.

The Ping Pong Buffer technique is often used in data streaming applications, where [[continuity.md|continuous]] data flow is required. It can also be found in graphics rendering (double buffering), where one buffer holds the frame being displayed while the other is being prepared.

The basic operation of a Ping Pong Buffer can be described by the following pseudocode:

```
initialize both buffers
while data is available:
    write data to back buffer
    swap front and back buffers
    read data from front buffer
```

The "swap" operation is typically a fast operation that just changes the [[Pointer|pointers]] to the buffers, rather than copying the data.

The Ping Pong Buffer technique is related to the broader concept of buffering in computer science. A buffer is a region of physical memory storage used to temporarily store data while it is being moved from one place to another. Buffers are often used when there is a difference between the rate at which data is received and the rate at which it can be processed.

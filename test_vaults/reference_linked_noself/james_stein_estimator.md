# James-Stein Estimator

The James-Stein estimator is a statistical estimation method that outperforms the traditional maximum likelihood estimation in certain situations. Named after Charles Stein and Will James, this estimator is used when estimating the mean of a multivariate [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]]. It's known for its counter-intuitive property where it improves the accuracy of estimates by "shrinking" them towards a central value, often resulting in smaller mean squared error compared to other estimators. This phenomenon is known as "Stein's paradox". The James-Stein estimator has significant implications in empirical Bayes methods and has influenced various areas of statistical theory and practice.

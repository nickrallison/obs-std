# Equivalence [[Binary Relation|Relation]]

An equivalence [[Binary Relation|relation]] is a type of [[Binary Relation|binary relation]] on a set that satisfies three properties: [[Reflexive Relation|reflexivity]], [[Symmetric Relation|symmetry]], and [[Transitive Relation|transitivity]]. These properties are defined as follows:

1. **[[Reflexive Relation|Reflexivity]]**: For all $x$ in the set, $x$ is related to itself. Formally, this is written as $xRx$ for all $x$ in the set.

2. **[[Symmetric Relation|Symmetry]]**: For all $x$ and $y$ in the set, if $x$ is related to $y$, then $y$ is related to $x$. Formally, this is written as $xRy$ implies $yRx$.

3. **[[Transitive Relation|Transitivity]]**: For all $x$, $y$, and $z$ in the set, if $x$ is related to $y$ and $y$ is related to $z$, then $x$ is related to $z$. Formally, this is written as $xRy$ and $yRz$ implies $xRz$.

An example of an equivalence [[Binary Relation|relation]] is the "is equal to" [[Binary Relation|relation]] on the set of integers. For any integer $x$, $x$ is equal to itself ([[Reflexive Relation|reflexivity]]), if $x$ is equal to $y$ then $y$ is equal to $x$ ([[Symmetric Relation|symmetry]]), and if $x$ is equal to $y$ and $y$ is equal to $z$, then $x$ is equal to $z$ ([[Transitive Relation|transitivity]]).

Equivalence [[Binary Relation|relations]] are important in many areas of mathematics. For example, they are used to define equivalence classes, which are subsets of the set on which the equivalence [[Binary Relation|relation]] is defined. Each equivalence class consists of all elements that are related to each other. In the example of the "is equal to" [[Binary Relation|relation]] on the set of integers, each equivalence class consists of a single integer, since each integer is only equal to itself.

Equivalence [[Binary Relation|relations]] are also used in the definition of quotient spaces in topology and algebra. A quotient space is a type of "factor" space that is obtained by "collapsing" all the elements of each equivalence class to a single point.

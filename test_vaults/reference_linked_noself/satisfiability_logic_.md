# Satisfiability (Logic)

Satisfiability in logic refers to the possibility of assigning truth values to variables in a way that makes a given proposition true. It is a fundamental concept in mathematical logic, computer science, and artificial intelligence, particularly in the field of automated theorem proving and [[Formal Verification|formal verification]]. A propositional formula is said to be satisfiable if there exists an interpretation (an assignment of truth values to variables) that makes the formula true. If no such interpretation exists, the formula is unsatisfiable. The problem of determining whether a formula is satisfiable is known as the satisfiability problem.

# Richard Feynman

Richard Feynman (1918-1988) was an American theoretical physicist known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle physics. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 for his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics.

Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, notably a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom" and the three-volume publication of his undergraduate lectures, "The Feynman Lectures on Physics". Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" and "What Do You Care What Other People Think?", and books written about him, such as "Tuva or Bust!".

Feynman also had a deep interest in biology, and was a friend of the geneticist and microbiologist Esther Lederberg, who developed replica plating and discovered bacteriophage [[Lambda Functions|lambda]]. They had several mutual physicist friends who wanted to know more about biology, including Murray Gell-Mann, who would later share the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physics.

One of Feynman's most lasting contributions to physics is in the field of quantum mechanics. He introduced diagrams, now called Feynman diagrams, that are graphical representations of the interactions of subatomic particles. For example, one such diagram might illustrate the paths taken by electrons and photons, and their interactions. The Feynman diagrams are now fundamental for string theory, quantum field theory, and particle physics.

Feynman's formulation of quantum mechanics using path integrals is another significant contribution. The path integral formulation extends the [[Principle of Least Action|principle of least action]] to quantum mechanics by considering all possible histories of a system, and it has proved instrumental in the study of quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, and quantum gravity.

Here is the basic idea of the path integral in quantum mechanics. The probability amplitude for a particle to go from point A at time $t_1$ to point B at time $t_2$ is given by the sum over all paths of the exponential of $i$ times the action $S$ for each path, divided by Planck's constant $h$:

$$
\langle B, t_2 | A, t_1 \rangle = \sum_{\text{all paths}} e^{iS/\hbar}
$$

Feynman's work in quantum electrodynamics (QED) is another cornerstone of his legacy. QED is a quantum field theory of electrodynamics, and it describes how light and matter interact. It is the first theory where full agreement between quantum mechanics and special relativity is achieved. QED mathematically describes all phenomena involving electrically charged particles interacting by means of exchange of photons, and it has been accurately tested in many experiments.

# Bilinear [[Linear Interpolation|Interpolation]]

Bilinear [[Linear Interpolation|Interpolation]] is a method in mathematical analysis used for estimating the value of a function for two variables when given a set of data points. It's applied in image processing for tasks like resizing and transformation. The technique involves performing [[Linear Interpolation|linear interpolation]] first in one direction, and then again in the other direction - hence the term 'bilinear'. It allows for smooth transitions and [[Gradient|gradients]], rather than abrupt changes in value, providing a more realistic output.

Not as smooth as a [[Bicubic Interpolation|Bicubic Interpolation]]. Simpler computationally.

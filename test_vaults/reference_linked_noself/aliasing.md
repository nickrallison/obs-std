# Aliasing

Aliasing is a phenomenon that occurs in signal processing and other fields when a high-frequency signal becomes indistinguishable from a lower-frequency signal. This happens when a [[Continuity|continuous signal]] is sampled at an insufficient rate, causing different signals to appear identical when sampled. The concept is fundamental to understanding the digitization of signals and the design of digital communication systems.

The mathematical basis for aliasing lies in the [[Shannon-Nyquist Sampling Criterion|Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem]], which states that a signal must be sampled at least twice as fast as its highest frequency component to be accurately represented. If the sampling frequency (also known as the sampling rate) is less than twice the highest frequency of the signal (the [[Nyquist Rate|Nyquist rate]]), aliasing occurs.

The [[Nyquist Rate|Nyquist rate]] is given by:

$$
f_{Nyquist} = 2f_{max}
$$

where $f_{max}$ is the maximum frequency component in the signal.

When a signal is sampled below its [[Nyquist Rate|Nyquist rate]], high-frequency components can "alias" to lower frequencies. This is because the samples do not occur frequently enough to distinguish the high-frequency oscillations, and instead, they appear as a slower oscillation or lower frequency.

The frequency of the aliased signal, $f_{alias}$, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
f_{alias} = |f_{signal} - Nf_{sample}|
$$

where $f_{signal}$ is the frequency of the original signal, $f_{sample}$ is the sampling frequency, and $N$ is an integer such that $f_{signal} - Nf_{sample}$ is between $-f_{sample}/2$ and $f_{sample}/2$.

Aliasing can be prevented by using an [[Anti Aliasing|anti-aliasing]] filter, which is a low-pass filter applied before sampling. This filter removes or attenuates the high-frequency components of the signal that are above the Nyquist frequency, thus preventing them from aliasing to lower frequencies.

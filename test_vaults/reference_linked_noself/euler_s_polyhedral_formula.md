# [[Leonhard Euler|Euler’s]] Polyhedral Formula

[[Leonhard Euler|Euler’s]] Polyhedral Formula refers to $F + V - E = 2$ where $F$ represents the number of faces, $V$ is the number of vertices, and $E$ is the number of edges in a [[Planar Graph|planar graph]]. This formula helps in understanding and analyzing complex graphs.

# [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] Of Infinity

The [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] of Infinity is a fundamental concept in set theory, a branch of mathematical logic. It states that there exists an infinite set, specifically a set that contains the number zero and the successor of every number it contains. This [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]] allows for the creation of an infinite series of natural numbers within the framework of set theory and ensures that infinite objects are part of our mathematical universe. Without this [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]], all sets would be finite and many mathematical concepts would not exist.

Basically this [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]] guarantees the existence of the following set:
$$
\{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}, \{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}\}, \{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}, \{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}\}\}, ...\}
$$
 Where $\varnothing$ maps to 0, $\{\varnothing\}$ maps to 1, â€¦
 
## Simple Explanation

The [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] of Infinity is a rule that says there exists a set that contains the number zero and for every number in the set, the next number is also in the set.

# Dynamic Memory Allocation

Dynamic Memory Allocation refers to the process of assigning memory space during the execution of a program. It involves allocating and deallocating memory blocks as per the requirements of the program. This allows more efficient use of memory as the size of the memory does not need to be pre-determined, it can change according to the needs of the program. This is particularly useful in situations where the memory requirement is not known until runtime. Dynamic Memory Allocation is handled in different ways in different programming languages, but generally involves use of specific functions or operators to allocate and deallocate memory.

# Intersection

Intersection, in the context of sets, refers to a mathematical operation that determines the common elements between two or more sets. If we have two sets, say Set A and Set B, the intersection of these two sets is a new set that contains all the elements which are in both Set A and Set B.

For instance, if Set A = {1, 2, 3} and Set B = {2, 3, 4}, then the intersection of Set A and Set B (denoted as A âˆ© B) is {2, 3}, because these are the elements that appear in both sets.

The concept of intersection is one of the fundamental operations in set theory and is used across many areas of mathematics including probability theory, statistics, logic and computer science.

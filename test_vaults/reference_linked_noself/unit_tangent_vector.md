# Unit [[Tangent Vector|Tangent Vector]]

The unit [[Tangent Vector|tangent vector]] is a concept used in [[Vector Valued Function|vector valued functions]], primarily in calculus and physics. It is a vector that is tangent to a curve at a given point and has a magnitude of one. This vector is often used to describe the direction of a curve at a certain point. The unit [[Tangent Vector|tangent vector]] is calculated by taking the derivative of the [[Vector Valued Function|vector valued function]], which represents the curve, and then normalizing it (dividing it by its magnitude) to make its length equal to one. This concept is fundamental in understanding motion along a curve, curvature, and other aspects of differential geometry.

Sure, the formula for calculating the unit [[Tangent Vector|tangent vector]] $\mathbf{T}$ of a [[Vector Valued Function|vector-valued function]] $\mathbf{r}(t)$ is given by:

$$
\mathbf{T}(t) = \frac{\mathbf{r}'(t)}{||\mathbf{r}'(t)||}
$$

Here, $\mathbf{r}'(t)$ is the derivative of the [[Vector Valued Function|vector valued function]] and $||\mathbf{r}'(t)||$ is its magnitude.

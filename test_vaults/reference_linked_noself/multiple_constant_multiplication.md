# Multiple Constant Multiplication

Multiple Constant Multiplication (MCM) is a technique used in digital signal processing and communication systems. It involves the multiplication of a variable by several constants. This process is typically carried out in hardware to improve efficiency and reduce computational complexity. MCM can be optimized to minimize the number of addition and subtraction operations, which can significantly improve the speed and power consumption of digital systems.

The optimization of MCM systems uses many [[Single Constant Multiplication|SCM]] systems together such that the total work done by the MCM system is less than the sum of work done by the [[Single Constant Multiplication|SCM]] systems.

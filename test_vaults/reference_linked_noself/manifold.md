# Manifold

The term "Manifold" is used in mathematics and physics to describe a space that is locally similar to Euclidean space. In simpler terms, it's a shape that, on a small scale, looks like a flat plane but can have more complex structure when viewed as a whole. For example, the surface of a sphere or a doughnut is considered a manifold. Manifolds can exist in any number of dimensions and are used in various fields such as physics, engineering, and computer science for modeling complex structures or spaces.

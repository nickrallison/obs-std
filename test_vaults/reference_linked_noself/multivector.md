# Multivector

Multivectors are a fundamental concept in Geometric Algebra, a mathematical framework that extends the traditional vector algebra and calculus. They are generalizations of vectors and can exist in any number of dimensions. 

A multivector in Geometric Algebra can be a scalar (a real number), a vector (an element of a [[Vector Space|vector space]]), a bivector (an oriented plane segment), a trivector (an oriented volume segment), and so on. The "multi" in multivector refers to the fact that a multivector can be a sum of these different types of elements.

The algebra of multivectors is generated by a finite-dimensional [[Vector Space|vector space]] equipped with a bilinear product called the [[Geometric Product|geometric product]]. The [[Geometric Product|geometric product]] of vectors has both a symmetric part (the [[Dot Product|dot product]]) and an [[antisymmetric_relation.md|antisymmetric]] part (the wedge product). 

The [[Dot Product|dot product]] of two vectors $a$ and $b$ is a scalar, denoted as $a \cdot b$. The wedge product of two vectors $a$ and $b$ is a bivector, denoted as $a \wedge b$. The [[Geometric Product|geometric product]] is then defined as $ab = a \cdot b + a \wedge b$.

The wedge product is [[antisymmetric_relation.md|antisymmetric]], meaning that $a \wedge b = -b \wedge a$. This property leads to the concept of oriented area: the bivector $a \wedge b$ represents the oriented area of the parallelogram spanned by $a$ and $b$.

The wedge product can be extended to more than two vectors. For example, the wedge product of three vectors $a$, $b$, and $c$ is a trivector, denoted as $a \wedge b \wedge c$, which represents the oriented volume of the parallelepiped spanned by $a$, $b$, and $c$.

The algebra of multivectors is a graded algebra, meaning that it is direct sum of subspaces of different grades. The grade of a multivector is the number of vectors in its wedge product. For example, a vector is a grade-1 multivector, a bivector is a grade-2 multivector, a trivector is a grade-3 multivector, and so on.

The algebra of multivectors also includes operations such as addition, scalar multiplication, [[Geometric Product|geometric product]], and the exterior derivative, which is a generalization of the [[Gradient|gradient]], [[Divergence|divergence]], and [[Curl|curl]] from vector calculus.

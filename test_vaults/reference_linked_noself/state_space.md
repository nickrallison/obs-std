# State Space

State Space is a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output and state variables related by first-order [[Differential Equations|differential equations]]. To represent the dynamics of a physical system, we use state variables that capture the characteristics of the system, and can predict its future behavior. 

The state space representation of a system is a common and compact method to describe systems governed by [[Linear Differential Equations|linear differential equations]]. It provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With inputs, outputs and states defined, the state and output equations can be written in matrix form.

The general form of state space representation is as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\dot{x}(t) &= Ax(t) + Bu(t) \\
y(t) &= Cx(t) + Du(t)
\end{align*}
$$

Where:
- $x(t)$ is the state vector, a set of variables representing the configuration of the system at time $t$.
- $u(t)$ is the input vector, representing external influences on the system at time $t$.
- $y(t)$ is the output vector, the set of variables representing the observable behavior of the system at time $t$.
- $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are matrices that define the state space representation of the system. $A$ is the state matrix, $B$ is the input matrix, $C$ is the output matrix, and $D$ is the feedforward matrix.

The state space representation is particularly useful because it allows for easy analysis and control design in the frequency domain using techniques like the [[Laplace Transform|Laplace transform]].

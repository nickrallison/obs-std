# [[Pierre Simone Laplace|Laplace's]] Rule of Succession

[[Pierre Simone Laplace|Laplace's]] Rule of Succession is a method for estimating the likelihood of a specific event happening, given that it has occurred a certain number of times in the past. It was formulated by French mathematician [[Pierre Simone Laplace|Pierre-Simon Laplace]]. The rule states that if an event has occurred 'n' times in 'N' trials, then the probability that it will occur on the next trial is '(n+1) / (N+2)'. This works well when there is limited data and assumes that events are independent and identically distributed. The rule essentially provides a way to balance past outcomes with an element of uncertainty about the future.

Sure, the formula for [[Pierre Simone Laplace|Laplace's]] Rule of Succession can be written in LaTeX as follows:
$$
P(\text{next event}) = \frac{n+1}{N+2}
$$
where $n$ is the number of times the event has occurred and $N$ is the total number of trials.

# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent takes actions in the environment, receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and adjusts its behavior to maximize the total reward over time.

The fundamental problem in RL is the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. The agent needs to balance the exploration of unvisited states to find potentially higher rewards and the exploitation of known states to gather rewards.

The key components of a RL system are:

1. **Agent**: The decision-making entity that interacts with the environment.
2. **Environment**: The world in which the agent operates.
3. **State**: A specific condition or situation in the environment.
4. **Action**: A move made by the agent that changes the state.
5. **Reward**: Feedback from the environment that guides the agent's learning.
6. **Policy**: The strategy that the agent employs to determine the next action based on the current state.

The RL process can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), defined by the tuple $(S, A, P, R, \gamma)$, where:

- $S$ is the [[State Space|state space]],
- $A$ is the action space,
- $P$ is the state transition probability matrix,
- $R$ is the reward function, and
- $\gamma$ is the discount factor.

The state transition probability $P_{ss'}^a$ is the probability of transitioning from state $s$ to state $s'$ under action $a$. The reward function $R_s^a$ is the expected reward for taking action $a$ in state $s$. The discount factor $\gamma$ is a number between 0 and 1 that determines the present value of future rewards.

The goal of the agent is to find the optimal policy $\pi^*$ that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted reward, also known as the value function $V^\pi(s)$, for all states $s \in S$. The value function under a policy $\pi$ is defined as:

$$
V^\pi(s) = E_\pi \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t R_{t+1} | S_t = s \right]
$$

The optimal value function $V^*(s)$ is the maximum value function over all policies:

$$
V^*(s) = \max_\pi V^\pi(s)
$$

The optimal policy $\pi^*$ is the policy that achieves the optimal value function.

There are several methods to solve the RL problem, including value iteration, policy iteration, and Q-learning. Q-learning is a popular method that learns the action-value function $Q(s, a)$, which is the expected return for taking action $a$ in state $s$ and following the optimal policy thereafter. The Q-learning update rule is:

$$
Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[ R_{t+1} + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right]
$$

where $\alpha$ is the learning rate.

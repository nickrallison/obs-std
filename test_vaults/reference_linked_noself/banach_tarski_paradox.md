# Banach Tarski Paradox

The Banach-Tarski Paradox is a principle in the field of mathematics, specifically in set theory and geometry. It states that it is theoretically possible to take a solid ball in 3-dimensional space, separate it into a finite number of non-overlapping pieces, and then reassemble these pieces into two solid balls identical to the original. Despite seeming counterintuitive as it defies the traditional concept of volume conservation, this paradox is possible due to the abstract nature of infinity in set theory. It relies on the [[Axiom of Choice|axiom of choice]], an important principle in set theory, but does not apply to physical reality as it assumes idealized mathematical conditions.

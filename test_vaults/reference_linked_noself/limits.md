# Limits

Limits in calculus are used to define [[Continuity|continuity]], derivatives, and integral. It is a fundamental concept that describes the behavior of functions as their inputs approach certain values. In simpler terms, limits answer the question: what value does a function approach as it gets arbitrarily close to a certain point? The limit can be finite or infinite and could be approached from the left side (negative direction) or from the right side (positive direction). If the function approaches the same value from both directions, it is said to have that limit at that point.

Here is the basic limit definition:

$$
\lim_{{x \to a}} f(x) = L
$$

This formula states that the limit of function $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches a value $a$ is equal to $L$.

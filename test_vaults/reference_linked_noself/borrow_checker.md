# [[Rust Ownership|Borrow]] Checker

The [[Rust Ownership|Borrow]] Checker is a unique feature of the Rust programming language that enforces strict [[Rust Ownership|borrowing]] and lifetime rules to ensure memory safety and thread safety without the need for a garbage collector. It is a part of the Rust compiler.

In Rust, any piece of data can only have one of the following states at a time:
1. No references.
2. Exactly one [[Mutability|mutable]] reference.
3. Any number of [[Mutability|immutable]] references.

The [[Rust Ownership|Borrow]] Checker enforces these rules at compile time, preventing data races and other concurrency issues. It does this by analyzing the code's control flow and ensuring that all references are valid for their entire lifetime.

Here's a simple example of how the [[Rust Ownership|Borrow]] Checker works:

```rust
let mut x = 5;
let y = &mut x; // y is a mutable reference to x
*y += 1; // we can modify x through y
let z = &x; // error: cannot borrow `x` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable
```

In this example, the [[Rust Ownership|Borrow]] Checker will not allow the code to compile because `x` is borrowed as [[Mutability|mutable]] when `z` tries to [[Rust Ownership|borrow]] it as [[Mutability|immutable.]] This is a violation of the [[Rust Ownership|borrowing]] rules.

The [[Rust Ownership|Borrow]] Checker also enforces lifetimes, which are annotations that tell the compiler how long references to data should be valid. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let r;                // -------+-- 'a
                          //        |
    {                     //        |
        let x = 5;        // -+-----+-- 'b
        r = &x;           //  |     |
    }                     // -+     |
                          //        |
    println!("r: {}", r); //        |
}                         // -------+
```

In this example, `r` has a longer lifetime ('a) than `x` ('b). When `x` goes out of scope, `r` is still referring to it, which is not allowed. The [[Rust Ownership|Borrow]] Checker will prevent this code from compiling.

The [[Rust Ownership|Borrow]] Checker is a powerful tool that makes Rust unique among programming languages. It allows for fine-grained control over memory and concurrency, leading to efficient and safe code.

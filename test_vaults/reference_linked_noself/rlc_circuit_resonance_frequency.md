# [[Resonance Peak|Resonance]] Frequency.md|RLC Circuit [[Resonance Peak|Resonance]] Frequency]]

RLC [[Resonance Peak|resonance]] frequency refers to a specific frequency at which the impedance of a series RLC circuit (a circuit that consists of a resistor (R), [[Inductor Current Voltage Equation|inductor]] (L), and capacitor (C)) is minimum or the impedance of a parallel RLC circuit is maximum. At this frequency, the circuit becomes purely resistive, meaning that the reactance (the opposition that electronic components present to the flow of alternating current) becomes zero. This results in maximum current or power transfer. The [[Resonance Peak|resonance]] frequency can be calculated using the values of resistance, inductance, and capacitance in the circuit. This concept is crucial in many areas of electronics and telecommunications.

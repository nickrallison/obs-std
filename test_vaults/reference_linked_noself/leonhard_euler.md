# Leonhard Euler

Leonhard Euler was a Swiss mathematician and physicist who made significant contributions to numerous areas of mathematics during the 18th century. He is known for introducing much of the mathematical terminology and notation that is still used today, including the concept of a mathematical function. His work spans many areas including calculus, graph theory, physics, astronomy and logic. Eulers formulaeep relationship between trigonometric functions and complex exponential functions, is named after him. Despite losing his sight later in life, Euler continued to produce research with the help of his memory and mental calculation skills. His prolific output means he remains one of the most influential figures in mathematics.

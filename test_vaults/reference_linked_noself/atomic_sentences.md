# Atomic Sentences

Atomic sentences, also referred to as atomic propositions or atomic formulas, are the most basic, indivisible units of meaning within [[Truth Functional Logic.md|propositional logic]] and predicate logic. They represent the simplest form of statements from which more complex logical sentences can be constructed. In the context of logic, understanding atomic sentences is crucial for developing an insight into how statements can be evaluated, combined, and manipulated in logical systems.

## In Propositional Logic

In propositional logic, an atomic sentence is typically represented by a single letter (such as $P$, $Q$, $R$, etc.) and indicates a statement that can either be true or false, but cannot be broken down into smaller statements. For instance, consider the statement "It is raining." This statement is seen as an atomic sentence because it conveys a complete idea that does not depend on any other statements for its verification and does not contain any [[Logical Connectives.md|logical connectives]] such as "and", "or", "if…then".

## In Predicate Logic

Moving a step further into complexity the realm of predicate logic, atomic sentences are constructed using predicate symbols that describe a property or [[Binary Relation|relation]], combined with individual constants or variables that stand in for objects within a domain of discourse. For instance, in the atomic sentence $Loves(John, Mary)$, the predicate $Loves$ expresses a relationship between the two individuals John and Mary. This sentence is atomic because it represents the simplest assertion that this logic can make about its domain without employing logical operators.

## Importance in Logical Systems

Atomic sentences serve as the foundational building blocks in the construction of more complex logical sentences through the use of logical connectives such as conjunctions (and), disjunctions (or), implications (if…then), and negations (not). The complexity of logical expressions builds up by combining these atomic sentences in various ways, allowing for the representation of a wide range of statements about the world.

## Evaluating Logical Statements

The evaluation of logical statements often begins with the assignment of truth values to atomic sentences. Once the truth values of the atomic sentences are known, these can be used to determine the truth values of more complex sentences constructed from them. This process is central to the study of logical [[Entailment|entailment]], where the truth of certain sentences (premises) is used to establish the truth of another sentence (conclusion), and to the practice of logical deduction.

## Conclusion

Understanding atomic sentences is crucial for anyone studying or using logic, whether in mathematics, philosophy, computer science, or other fields. As the simplest units of logic, atomic sentences form the foundation upon which logical reasoning, argumentation, and proof are built.

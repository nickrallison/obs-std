# Universal [[Binary Relation|Relation]]

The Universal [[Binary Relation|Relation]] in logic is a concept that refers to a [[Binary Relation|relation]] that holds between every pair of elements in a given set. In other words, it is a [[Binary Relation|relation]] that is true for all possible combinations of elements. This concept is often used in mathematical logic and theoretical computer science, particularly in the study of relational databases and data structures. The universal [[Binary Relation|relation]] is the opposite of the empty [[Binary Relation|relation]], which holds between no pairs of elements.

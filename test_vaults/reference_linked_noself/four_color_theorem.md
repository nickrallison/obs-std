# Four Color Theorem

The Four Color Theorem is a theorem in mathematics that states that, given any separation of a plane into contiguous regions, producing a figure called a map, no more than four colors are required to color the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color. Adjacent means that two regions share a common boundary curve segment, not merely a point.

The theorem was first proposed in 1852 by Francis Guthrie, while trying to color the map of counties of England. The conjecture was then communicated to the mathematical community by [[Augustus Demorgan|Augustus De Morgan]].

The Four Color Theorem is famous in the history of mathematics mainly because the proofs involve an unusual combination of combinatorics and topology, with an assist from technology. The first proof was given by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken in 1976, and it was the first major theorem to be proved using a computer. Appel and Haken's approach started by showing that there is a particular set of 1,936 maps, each of which cannot be part of a smallest-sized counterexample to the four color theorem. Appel and Haken used a computer program to confirm that each of these maps had this property. Additionally, any map that could potentially be a counterexample must contain a configuration called a "discharging configuration", which was proven to be impossible to find.

The proof was controversial because it was infeasible for a human to verify by hand (over a thousand hours of computer time was required for the calculations). Since then the proof has been simplified and the computational part has been independently verified.

The Four Color Theorem can be stated formally in terms of graph theory: Every [[Planar Graph|planar graph]] (or, equivalently, every loopless planar map) is four [[Graph Colouring|colorable]]. Here, "coloring" means assignment of labels (called colors) to vertices of a graph G such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

The Four Color Theorem has no known simple proof because, as far as we know, any proof must involve a case-by-case analysis of a large number of possibilities, which cannot be reduced to a small, manageable number by standard proof methods.

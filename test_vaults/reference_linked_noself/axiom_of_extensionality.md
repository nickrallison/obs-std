# [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] Of Extensionality

The [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] of Extensionality is a principle in set theory that states two sets are identical if and only if they have the same elements. In other words, if every element of set A is also an element of set B, and every element of set B is also an element of set A, then A and B are the same set. This [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]] is fundamental to the definition and understanding of sets in mathematics.

$$
\forall A \forall B [\forall x (x \in A \Leftrightarrow x \in B) \Rightarrow A = B]
$$

## Simple Explanation

Two sets are identical if they have the exact same elements.

# Vector Field

A vector field is a mathematical construct that assigns a vector to each point in a subset of space. In the context of physics, for example, a vector field might represent the velocity or force vectors of a moving fluid at each point in the fluid.

The mathematical definition of a vector field in three-dimensional space is a function $F: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ that assigns to each point $(x, y, z)$ a vector $F(x, y, z) = (F_1(x, y, z), F_2(x, y, z), F_3(x, y, z))$, where $F_1, F_2, F_3$ are scalar functions.

A vector field can be visualized as a flow of arrows where the direction of an arrow represents the direction of the vector and the length of an arrow represents the magnitude of the vector.

One of the key operations on vector fields is the [[Divergence|divergence]], which measures the rate at which "density" exits a given region of space. The [[Divergence|divergence]] of a vector field $F = (F_1, F_2, F_3)$ is given by the scalar function:

$$
\nabla \cdot F = \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial F_3}{\partial z}
$$

Another key operation is the [[Curl|curl]], which measures the rate of rotation (or angular momentum) of the vectors in a vector field around a given point. The [[Curl|curl]] of a vector field $F = (F_1, F_2, F_3)$ is given by the vector function:

$$
\nabla \times F = \left(\frac{\partial F_3}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial z}, \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial F_3}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y}\right)
$$

The [[Divergence Theorem|divergence theorem]] and [[Stokes’ Theorem|Stokes' theorem]] are two important theorems involving vector fields. The [[Divergence Theorem|divergence theorem]] relates the flux of a vector field across a closed surface to the [[Divergence|divergence]] of the vector field inside the volume enclosed by the surface:

$$
\int\int\int_V (\nabla \cdot F) \, dV = \int\int_S F \cdot dS
$$

[[Stokes’ Theorem|Stokes' theorem]] relates the circulation of a vector field around a closed loop to the [[Curl|curl]] of the vector field over the surface spanned by the loop:

$$
\int_C F \cdot dr = \int\int_S (\nabla \times F) \cdot dS
$$

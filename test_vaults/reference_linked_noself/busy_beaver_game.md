# [[Busy Beaver Series|Busy Beaver]] Game

The [[Busy Beaver Series|Busy Beaver]] Game is a concept in the field of [[Computability|computability]] theory within mathematics and computer science. The game involves designing a [[Turing Machine|Turing machine]] (a mathematical model of computation) that performs the longest possible computation before it halts, given a specific number of states. The term "[[busy_beaver_series.md|Busy Beaver]]" refers to this hypothetical [[Turing Machine|Turing machine]]. The game was first introduced by mathematician Tibor Rad√≥ in 1962. It helps to explore the [[Limits|limits]] of what can be computed and has implications for the unsolvability problem in computer science.

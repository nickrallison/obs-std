# Generating Functions

Generating functions are a way to encode information about a sequence or a set of numbers in the form of a power series. They are used in various areas of mathematics, including combinatorics, calculus, and number theory. The coefficients of the power series represent the elements of the sequence or set. Generating functions can be manipulated algebraically to derive properties about the sequence or set they represent. They are particularly useful in solving counting problems and finding closed-form solutions to [[Difference Equations|recurrence relations]].

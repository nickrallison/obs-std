# [[Continuity|Continuous]] Distribution

A [[Continuity|continuous]] distribution, in statistics, represents the probabilities of possible outcomes for a [[Continuity|continuous]] [[Random Variable|random variable]], which can take on an infinite number of possible values within a specified range. This is different from a discrete distribution, where the variable can only take specific values. Examples of [[Continuity|continuous]] distributions include [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]], exponential distribution, and [[Uniform Distribution|uniform distribution]]. The probability of a [[Continuity|continuous]] [[Random Variable|random variable]] taking on a specific value is typically zero; instead, probabilities are associated with ranges of values. The total probability across the entire range of a [[Continuity|continuous]] [[Random Variable|random variable]] is equal to 1.

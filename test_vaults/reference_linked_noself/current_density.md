# Current Density

Current density is a measure of the amount of electric current (charge flow in amperes) per unit area of cross section (in square meters). It is a vector quantity with its magnitude equal to the electric current per cross-sectional area. The direction of current density is always in the direction in which positive charges move. It is often used in describing the distribution of a current within a conducting medium, such as a wire or a semiconductor. The concept is crucial in fields like electromagnetism and electronics.

The relevant formula for current density (J) is given by:

$$
\vec{J} = \frac{I}{A}
$$

Or written as a [[Dot Product|Dot Product]] of [[Vector Field|vector fields]]: 

$$
I = \iint\limits_A\vec{J}\cdot d\vec{A}
$$

where:
- $\vec{J}$ is the current density, measured in amperes per square meter (A/m²)
- $I$ is the current, measured in amperes (A)
- $A$ is the cross-sectional area, measured in square meters (m²)

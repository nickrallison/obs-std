# Phase Modulation

Phase Modulation (PM) is a method used in signal modulation, which is the process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform, called the carrier signal, with a separate signal that contains [[Information Theory|information]] to be transmitted. In Phase Modulation, the phase of the carrier signal is altered in accordance with the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal. The frequency and amplitude of the carrier signal remain constant while its phase varies.

This modulation technique is widely used in digital data transmission and wireless communication systems because it provides high performance under [[Signal Bandwidth|bandwidth]] constraints and noise interference. Its also an integral part of more complex modulation schemes like Quadrature-Amplitude-Modulation (QAM), which is commonly used in Wi-Fi and cable television technology.

In simple terms, Phase Modulation allows us to encode [[Information Theory|information]] into a carrier wave by changing its phase, thus enabling us to transmit data over long distances.

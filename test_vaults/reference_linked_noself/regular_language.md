# Regular Language

To understand regular languages, we need to define some key concepts:

1. **Alphabet**: An alphabet is a finite set of symbols. It is denoted by Σ. For example, Σ = {0, 1} represents the [[Binary String|binary alphabet]].

2. **String**: A string is a finite sequence of symbols from an alphabet. It can be empty or contain one or more symbols. For example, "0101" is a string over the [[Binary String|binary alphabet]] Σ = {0, 1}.

3. **Language**: A language is a set of strings over an alphabet. It can be finite or infinite. For example, the language L = {0, 1, 00, 11, 000, 111, …} contains all strings of 0s and 1s with any number of repetitions.

4. **[[Regular Expression|Regular Expression]]**: A [[Regular Expression|regular expression]] is a compact notation for representing regular languages. It is a sequence of symbols and operators that define a pattern. [[Regular Expression|Regular expressions]] can be used to describe strings that belong to a specific language. For example, the [[Regular Expression|regular expression]] "0\*1" represents the language of all strings that start with zero and end with one, with any number of zeros in between.

5. **Regular Grammar**: A regular grammar is a [[Formal Grammar|formal grammar]] that generates a regular language. It consists of a set of production rules that define how to generate strings in the language. Regular grammars are often used to describe the syntax of programming languages.

6. **Regular Operation**: Regular operations are operations that can be applied to regular languages to create new regular languages. Some common regular operations include [[Union|union]], concatenation, and Kleene star.

7. **[[Finite Automata|Finite Automaton]]**: A [[Finite Automata|finite automaton]] is a mathematical model of computation that recognizes regular languages. It consists of a finite set of states, an input alphabet, a transition function, a start state, and a set of accepting states. [[Finite Automata|Finite automata]] can be deterministic ([[Finite Automata|DFA]]) or non-deterministic ([[Finite Automata|NFA]]).

8. **[[Pumping Lemma|Pumping Lemma]]**: The [[Pumping Lemma|Pumping Lemma]] is a tool used to prove that a language is not regular. It states that for any regular language, there exists a pumping length such that any string longer than the pumping length can be divided into several parts, one of which can be repeated any number of times to generate a string that is not in the language.

These concepts form the foundation of regular languages. By combining [[Regular Expression|regular expressions]], regular grammars, and [[Finite Automata|finite automata]], we can define and manipulate regular languages. The theory of regular languages is well-studied and has been extensively researched, leading to various algorithms and techniques for working with regular languages.

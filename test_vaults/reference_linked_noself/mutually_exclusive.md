# Mutually Exclusive

"Mutually exclusive" is a term used in probability theory and statistics to describe a situation where two events cannot occur at the same time. Essentially, if one event happens, the other cannot. For instance, flipping a coin and getting both heads and tails simultaneously is mutually exclusive - it's either one or the other, not both. This concept is vital in many areas of study such as mathematics, business, psychology, and more.

# Binary String

A binary string is a sequence of bits, which are the most basic units of information in computing and digital communications. The term "binary string" is often used interchangeably with "bit string", "binary sequence", or "bit sequence". Each bit in a binary string can be either 0 or 1, representing two possible states.

Binary strings are fundamental to computer science because they represent data at the lowest level. All data in a computer is ultimately represented as a sequence of bits. For example, an 8-bit binary string can represent a byte, which is a basic unit of information storage and processing in computers.

The length of a binary string is the number of bits it contains. For example, the binary string 1011 has a length of 4. The set of all binary strings of length n is often denoted as {0,1}^n.

Binary strings can be manipulated using bitwise operations, which are operations that act on individual bits. Common bitwise operations include AND, OR, XOR (exclusive OR), NOT, and bit shifts.

The number of possible binary strings of length n is 2^n. This is because each bit can be either 0 or 1, so there are 2 choices for each bit, and these choices are independent. Therefore, the total number of possibilities is 2 multiplied by itself n times.

In the context of information theory, the entropy of a binary string is a measure of its randomness or unpredictability. The entropy H(X) of a binary [[Random Variable|random variable]] X is defined as:

$$
H(X) = -p \log_2 p - (1 - p) \log_2 (1 - p)
$$

where p is the probability that X = 1. The entropy is maximized (and equals 1) when p = 0.5, which corresponds to a binary string that is equally likely to be 0 or 1. The entropy is minimized (and equals 0) when p = 0 or p = 1, which corresponds to a binary string that is always 0 or always 1.

In the context of coding theory, binary strings are used to represent codewords in binary error-correcting codes. A binary code is a set of binary strings that are used to represent data in a way that allows for error detection and correction. The Hamming distance between two binary strings is the number of bit positions in which they differ, and it is a fundamental concept in coding theory.

In the context of cryptography, binary strings are used to represent keys, plaintexts, and ciphertexts. The security of a cryptographic system often depends on the unpredictability of its keys, which are typically represented as random binary strings.

In the context of computational complexity theory, the complexity of a problem is often expressed in terms of the length of its input, which is represented as a binary string. For example, the [[Big-O Notation|time complexity]] of an algorithm might be expressed as a function of the length of its input binary string.

# Syntax of [[Truth Functional Logic|Truth Functional Logic]]

[[Truth Functional Logic|Truth-functional logic]], also known as [[Truth Functional Logic|propositional logic]], is a type of formal logic that deals with propositions and their combinations. The syntax of [[Truth Functional Logic|truth-functional logic]] is concerned with the rules for constructing well-formed formulas (wffs) from [[Atomic Sentences.md|atomic propositions]] and [[Logical Connectives|logical connectives]].

**Atomic Propositions**

Atomic propositions are the fundamental units in [[Truth Functional Logic|truth-functional logic]]. They are often represented by lowercase letters such as $p$, $q$, and $r$. Each atomic proposition can be either true or false.

**[[Logical Connectives|Logical Connectives]]**

[[Logical Connectives|Logical connectives]] are symbols that combine [[Atomic Sentences.md|atomic propositions]] into more complex propositions.The main [[Logical Connectives|logical connectives]] in [[Truth Functional Logic|truth-functional logic]] are:

1. Negation ($\neg$): This is a unary connective that flips the truth value of a proposition. If $p$ is true, then $\neg p$ is false, and vice versa.

2. Conjunction ($\land$): This is a binary connective that combines two propositions into a larger proposition that is true if and only if both of the original propositions are true. For example, $p \land q$ is true if and only if $p$ is true and $q$ is true.

3. Disjunction ($\lor$): This is a binary connective that combines two propositions into a larger proposition that is true if at least one of the original propositions is true. For example, $p \lor q$ is true if $p$ is true, or $q$ is true, or both.

4. Implication ($\rightarrow$): This is a binary connective that represents the logical relationship "if…then…". For example, $p \rightarrow q$ is true unless $p$ is true and $q$ is false.

5. Biconditional ($\leftrightarrow$): This is a binary connective that represents the logical relationship "if and only if". For example, $p \leftrightarrow q$ is true if $p$ and $q$ are both true or both false.

**Well-Formed Formulas (wffs)**

A well-formed formula is a string of symbols that is constructed according to the syntax rules of [[Truth Functional Logic|truth-functional logic]]. The rules for constructing wffs are as follows:

1. Every atomic proposition is a wff.
2. If $P$ is a wff, then so is $\neg P$.
3. If $P$ and $Q$ are wffs, then so are $(P \land Q)$, $(P \lor Q)$, $(P \rightarrow Q)$, and $(P \leftrightarrow Q)$.
4. Nothing else is a wff.

**Derivations and Proofs**

In [[Truth Functional Logic|truth-functional logic]], derivations and proofs are used to show that a certain proposition follows logically from a set of premises. A derivation is a sequence of wffs, each of which is either a premise, an assumption, or follows from previous wffs by a rule of inference. A proof is a successful derivation that ends with the proposition to be proved.

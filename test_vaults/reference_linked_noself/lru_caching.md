# LRU [[Caching|Caching]]

LRU [[Caching|Caching,]] or Least Recently Used [[Caching|Caching,]] is a type of [[Caching|caching]] algorithm that keeps track of what items are used and how often. It removes the least recently used items first when the [[Caching|cache]] memory is full. This method is easy to implement and efficient in terms of complexity, making it a popular choice for [[Caching|cache]] replacement algorithms. LRU [[Caching|Caching]] is commonly used in various computing applications to speed up data retrieval processes by storing frequently accessed data in a [[Caching|cache.]]

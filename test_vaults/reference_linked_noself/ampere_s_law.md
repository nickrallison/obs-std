# Ampere's Law

️Ampere's Law states that the total magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is proportional to the current (I) flowing through it. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

∇⋅B = μ₀J

where ∇ is the del operator, B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space, and J is the current density.

This law applies to any closed loop, regardless of its shape or size. It's a fundamental principle in electromagnetism, used to calculate the magnetic fields around conductors carrying electric currents.️️

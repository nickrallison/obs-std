# [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] Schema of Specification

The [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] Schema of Specification, also known as the [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] of Separation or the [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] of Comprehension, is a principle in set theory that allows the construction of a set from elements of another set based on a certain property. It states that for any property and any set, there is a subset comprising exactly those elements in the original set which satisfy the property. This [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]] avoids paradoxes in set theory by preventing unrestricted comprehension, which would allow for sets to contain themselves.

## Simple Explanation

The [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] Schema of Specification is a rule that allows you to create a new set from an existing set by specifying certain conditions that the elements must meet.

# Finite [[Automata Theory|Automata Theory]]

Finite [[Automata Theory|Automata Theory]], also known as [[Finite State Machines|Finite State Machines]], are abstract computational models that can be used to simulate various types of systems and devices. They are called "finite" because they have a limited number of states. A Finite [[Automata Theory|Automata Theory]] includes states and transitions between these states which occur based on some input. It can be categorized into two types: Deterministic Finite [[Automata Theory|Automata Theory]] (DFA) where one input leads to one state, and Non-deterministic Finite [[Automata Theory|Automata Theory]] (NFA) where one input can lead to multiple states. These models are widely used in computer science, specifically in areas like lexical analysis and pattern matching.

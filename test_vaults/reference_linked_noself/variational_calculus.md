# Variational Calculus

Variational calculus is a mathematical field that focuses on finding the function which minimizes or maximizes a certain functional (a functional is a function of functions). This type of calculus is primarily used in physics and engineering to solve problems that require optimizing a certain parameter. The most common method used in variational calculus is the [[Euler Lagrange Equation|Euler-Lagrange equation]]. Overall, variational calculus plays an essential role in several scientific and mathematical disciplines, including quantum mechanics, classical mechanics, and control theory.

The [[Euler Lagrange Equation|Euler-Lagrange equation]] is:

$$
\begin{gather*} 
\frac{\partial L}{\partial f} - \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial f'}\right) = 0
\end{gather*}
$$

where $L$ is the [[Euler Lagrange Equation|Lagrangian]], $f$ is the function we want to optimize, and $f$ is the derivative of $f$.

# Joint Possibilities and Impossibilities

Joint possibility refers to a situation where there is a set of conditions or statements that can all be true at the same time. For example, “It is raining and cloudy” is a joint possibility because it is possible for both statements to be true under certain circumstances. On the other hand, joint impossibility refers to a situation where there is a set of conditions or statements that cannot all be true at the same time. For example, “It is raining and the sun is shining” is a joint impossibility.

This is related to the [[Boolean Satisfiability|SAT]] problem as these are both looking to find if there is a way to make some number of statements jointly true.

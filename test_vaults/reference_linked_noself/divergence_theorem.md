# [[Divergence|Divergence]] Theorem

The [[Divergence|Divergence]] Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem, is a fundamental theorem in vector calculus that relates the flux of a [[Vector Field|vector field]] through a closed surface to the [[Divergence|divergence]] of the field in the volume enclosed by the surface. 

The theorem is formally stated as follows:

$$
\int\int\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) \, dV = \int\int_S \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S}
$$

where:
- $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}$ is the [[Divergence|divergence]] of the [[Vector Field|vector field]] $\mathbf{F}$,
- $dV$ is an infinitesimal volume element in the volume $V$,
- $\mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S}$ is the flux of $\mathbf{F}$ across an infinitesimal area element $d\mathbf{S}$ of the closed surface $S$ bounding $V$,
- The left-hand side is a triple integral over the volume $V$,
- The right-hand side is a surface integral over the surface $S$.

The [[Divergence|Divergence]] Theorem is a special case of the more general [[Stokes’ Theorem|Stokes' Theorem]], which relates a surface integral of a [[Vector Field|vector field]] to a line integral around the boundary of the surface.

The proof of the [[Divergence|Divergence]] Theorem is typically done in Cartesian coordinates, and it involves showing the theorem is true for a tiny cube and then extending it to arbitrary volumes by partitioning them into tiny cubes. The proof is quite involved and requires a solid understanding of multivariable calculus.

Tangentially related items include other theorems in vector calculus such as [[Green's Theorem|Green's Theorem]] and [[Stokes’ Theorem|Stokes' Theorem]], as well as the concept of [[Divergence|divergence]] and its geometric interpretation as the rate at which "density" exits a region.

# Torify

"Torify" is a program that allows users to use the [[Tor|Tor]] network for internet communication. [[Tor|Tor]] is a free and open-source software that enables anonymous communication by directing internet traffic through a network of servers worldwide. This helps in protecting the user's privacy and security by concealing their usage from surveillance as well as traffic analysis. "Torify" is effectively used to 'torify' applications, allowing them to operate over the [[Tor|Tor]] network.

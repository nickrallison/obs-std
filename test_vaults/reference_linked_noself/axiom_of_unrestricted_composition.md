# [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] Of Unrestricted Composition

The [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] of Unrestricted Composition is a principle in set theory, a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which are collections of objects. This [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]] essentially states that for any property or condition, there exists a set of all objects that satisfy this condition. 

However, this [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]] leads to a paradox known as [[Russell's Paradox|Russell's Paradox]]. This paradox is named after the British philosopher and logician Bertrand Russell, who discovered it in 1901. The paradox arises from considering the set of all sets that do not contain themselves as a member. If such a set exists, then it must both contain itself (since it does not contain itself) and not contain itself (by its own definition), which is a [[Proof by Contradiction|contradiction]].

This paradox exposed the inconsistency in [[Naive Set Theory|naive set theory]], which was the initial framework for studying sets. In response to this paradox, several modifications were made to the [[Naive Set Theory|naive set theory]] to avoid such [[Contradictions|contradictions]]. One such modification is the restriction of the [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] of Unrestricted Composition, which means that not all properties or conditions define a set.

In other words, in modern set theories like [[Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory|Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]], the existence of certain sets is not assumed by default. Instead, other [[Mathematical Axioms|axioms]] are used to construct sets in a controlled manner to avoid [[Contradictions|contradictions]] like [[Russell's Paradox|Russell's Paradox]].

## Simple Explanation

The [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] of Unrestricted Composition is a rule in set theory that says you can make a set from anything that meets a certain condition.

# Weighted Graph

A weighted graph is a type of graph in which each edge is assigned a numerical value or weight. This weight can represent various things depending on the problem at hand, such as cost, distance, quantity, or capacity. The total weight of a path through the graph is calculated by adding up the weights of the edges along that path. Weighted graphs are commonly used in algorithms for finding the shortest path or [[Minimum Spanning Tree|minimum spanning tree]] in a network.

# Akra-Bazzi Theorem

The Akra-Bazzi theorem is a method used to solve asymptotically [[Difference Equations|recurrence relations]], which are equations that recursively define a sequence. This theorem is particularly useful for solving [[Difference Equations|recurrence relations]] that arise in the analysis of the [[Big-O Notation|time complexity]] of [[Divide and Conquer|divide-and-conquer]] algorithms.

The Akra-Bazzi theorem is an extension of the [[Master Theorem|Master theorem]], which is used to determine the [[Big-O Notation|time complexity]] of [[Divide and Conquer|divide-and-conquer]] algorithms with constant ratios of sub-problem sizes and equal work done at each level of recursion. However, the [[Master Theorem|Master theorem]] has limitations and cannot handle certain types of [[Difference Equations|recurrence relations]]. The Akra-Bazzi theorem overcomes these limitations and can handle more general forms of [[Difference Equations|recurrence relations]].

The Akra-Bazzi theorem is stated as follows:

Given a recurrence of the form:

$$
T(n) = g(n) + \sum_{i=1}^{k} a_i T(b_i n + h_i(n))
$$

where $a_i > 0$, $b_i > 1$, $g(n)$ is a positive function that is $O(n^c)$ for some $c$, and $g(n)$ is continuously differentiable, the asymptotic solution will be:

$$
T(n) = \Theta \left( n^p \left( 1+ \int_{1}^{n} \frac{g(u)}{u^{p+1}} du \right) \right)
$$

where $p$ is the unique real solution of the equation:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k} a_i b_i^{-p} = 1
$$

The proof of the Akra-Bazzi theorem is quite involved and requires a good understanding of calculus and mathematical analysis. The proof involves the use of the [[Laplace Transform|Laplace transform]], complex analysis, and the method of steepest descent. The proof is beyond the scope of this response, but you can find a detailed proof in the original paper by Akra and Bazzi.

The Akra-Bazzi theorem is a powerful tool in the analysis of algorithms, especially [[Divide and Conquer|divide-and-conquer]] algorithms. It allows us to solve [[Difference Equations|recurrence relations]] that cannot be solved by the [[Master Theorem|Master theorem]] and provides a general method for analyzing the [[Big-O Notation|time complexity]] of algorithms.

## Introduction to Algorithms 4e - Pages 137-140 Summary

The Akra-Bazzi method finds its roots in addressing recurrences that are a more generalized version of those handled by the [[Master Theorem|master theorem]]. It has the capability to depict the walking-through time of algorithms that dissect a problem into various-sized sub-problems. It further distinguishes itself from the [[Master Theorem|master theorem]] by necessitating the consideration of floors and ceilings. The notion of the polynomial-growth condition, which under specified circumstances allows the disregarding of floors and ceilings, is also spotlighted within this section. Crucially, functions exemplifying this type of growth are among those that meet the criteria of this condition.

The given section also expands on the principle of polynomially constrained functions, emphasizing how they manifest within Akra-Bazzi recurrences. Here, the narrative clarifies that assuming a driving function adheres to the polynomial-growth condition, the presence of floors and ceilings does not influence the asymptotic nature of the solution. This idea gets formalized through the presentation of Theorem 4.5. The narrative signals that floors and ceilings essentially cause a maximum disruption of 1 in the arguments of the recursion. The section elaborates on this: if the driving function conforms to the polynomial-growth condition, the process of replacing any term in the recurrence with a disturbed one bears no impact on the asymptotic solution. This feature allows a [[Divide and Conquer|divide-and-conquer]] algorithm to encompass somewhat coarse partitions during its divide phase, without disturbing the solution to its running-time recurrence.

The Akra-Bazzi method is further highlighted as a technique for solving Akra-Bazzi recurrences with its capacity to handle floors, ceilings, and even more sizable perturbations. The methodology involves the identification of a unique real value, denoted by p, that satisfies a specific equation, leading to a formula for the solution to the given recurrence. A practical example of a recurrence is given to illustrate the application of the Akra-Bazzi method. Here, it is pointed out that solving the example does not require exact knowledge of p, instead, the range of potential values for p are exploited. Moreover, an element of calculus is referenced as instrumental to the approach.

In essence, this section provides a thorough exploration of two advanced aspects in [[Divide and Conquer|divide-and-conquer]] recurrencesâ€”with a noteworthy emphasis on understanding floors and ceilings, as well as unraveling the Akra-Bazzi method for solving these recurrences. It is evident that these topics are interconnected, collectively outlining a comprehensive view of [[Divide and Conquer|divide-and-conquer]] recurrences.

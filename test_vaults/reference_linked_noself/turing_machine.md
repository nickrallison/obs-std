# [[Alan Turing|Turing]] Machine

A [[Alan Turing|Turing]] Machine is a theoretical computational device, conceived by British mathematician [[Alan Turing|Alan Turing]] in 1936. Its an abstract model of computation that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite its simplicity, a [[Alan Turing|Turing]] machine can simulate the logic of any computer algorithm and is used in theoretical computer science to understand what can be computed. Its also a key concept in the theory of computation and [[Computability|computability.]]

# Eigenvectors

Eigenvectors are a type of vector associated with linear systems and transformations that have the unique property of maintaining their direction even after a transformation has been applied. They are used in various fields, including physics, computer science, and engineering. Eigenvectors are often paired with [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalues]], which represent the scalar by which the eigenvector is stretched or shrunk during a transformation. Together, eigenvectors and [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] provide critical insights into the properties and behaviours of linear systems.

The concept of eigenvectors and [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] can be represented as follows:

$$
\begin{gather*} 
Av = \lambda v 
\end{gather*}
$$

Where:
- $A$ is a square matrix,
- $v$ is the eigenvector of the matrix $A$, and
- $\lambda$ is the [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalue]] corresponding to the eigenvector $v$.

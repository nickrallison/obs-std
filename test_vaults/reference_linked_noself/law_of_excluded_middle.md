# Law of Excluded Middle

The Law of Excluded Middle (LEM) is a principle in classical logic that states for any proposition, either that proposition is true, or its negation is true. This can be formally represented as:

$$
P \vee \neg P
$$

where $P$ is any proposition, $\vee$ denotes the logical OR operator, and $\neg$ denotes negation. 

The LEM is one of the three classic laws of thought, alongside the Law of [[Identity Element|Identity]] ($P \equiv P$) and the Law of Non-Contradiction ($\neg (P \wedge \neg P)$), where $\equiv$ denotes [[Logical Equivalence|logical equivalence]] and $\wedge$ denotes the logical AND operator.

The LEM is a cornerstone of classical logic, but it is not universally accepted in all logical systems. For example, in intuitionistic logic, the LEM is not accepted as a general principle. Intuitionists argue that to assert a disjunction (i.e., an OR statement), one must have specific knowledge of which disjunct is true. This contrasts with the classical view, which allows for the assertion of a disjunction without knowing which disjunct is true.

The LEM also has implications in set theory and mathematics. For example, the [[Axiom of Choice|Axiom of Choice]] in set theory, which is independent of the other [[Mathematical Axioms|axioms]] of set theory, can be seen as a form of the LEM applied to infinite sets.

# Pierre De Fermat

Pierre de Fermat was a French lawyer and mathematician who is best known for his work in the field of number theory. He made significant contributions to the development of calculus, probability theory, and analytic geometry. However, he is most famous for his Last Theorem, which states that there are no three positive integers a, b, and c that can satisfy the equation $a^n + b^n = c^n, \forall n>2$ for any integer value of n greater than two. This theorem puzzled mathematicians for centuries until it was finally proven by Andrew Wiles in 1994. Despite his significant contributions to mathematics, Fermat was not a professional mathematician and most of his work was done in his spare time.

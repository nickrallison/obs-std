# Dual Graph

A dual graph is a concept in mathematics, specifically in graph theory. It is derived from a [[Planar Graph|planar graph]], which is a type of graph that can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing each other. In the dual graph, every face of the original [[Planar Graph|planar graph]] is represented as a vertex. The edges in the dual graph are drawn between vertices that correspond to faces in the original graph that are adjacent to each other. 

Dual graphs are used in various fields including computer graphics, geographic information systems (GIS), and various algorithms related to network optimization and flow problems.

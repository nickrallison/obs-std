# [[Augustus Demorgan|Demorgans]] Laws

[[Augustus Demorgan|DeMorgans]] Laws are rules in the field of logic and set theory that relate to the concepts of [[Union|union]] and [[Intersection|intersection]] in a set, as well as conjunction and disjunction in a logical expression. Theyre named after mathematician [[Augustus Demorgan|Augustus De Morgan]].
1. The negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations.  
In simpler terms, "not (A and B)" is the same as "(not A) or (not B)".
2. The negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations.  
This means "not (A or B)" is equivalent to "(not A) and (not B)".  
These laws can be very useful for simplifying complex logical expressions, as well as working with sets in mathematics.

# [[Pierre Simone Laplace|Laplace]] Transform

The [[Pierre Simone Laplace|Laplace]] transform is a mathematical tool used to solve [[Differential Equations|differential equations]]. Named after [[Pierre Simone Laplace|Pierre-Simon Laplace]], it changes a function of a real variable t (time) to a function of a complex variable s (frequency).  
The transform has the useful property that many relationships and operations over the original function correspond to simpler relationships and operations over its image. It simplifies calculations in engineering fields like control theory, circuit analysis, signal processing, and physics.  
In addition, the [[Pierre Simone Laplace|Laplace]] transform is used in probability theory to analyze stochastic processes such as queues or random walks. Its also used in [[LTI System Stability|system stability]] analysis within control theory and in digital signal processing.

$$
\begin{gather*} 
\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} = F(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt
\end{gather*}
$$

Here is an example of solving a [[Pierre Simone Laplace|Laplace]] Transform problem:

Given the function $f(t) = e^{-2t}$, find its [[Pierre Simone Laplace|Laplace]] Transform.

Solution:

The [[Pierre Simone Laplace|Laplace]] Transform of $e^{-at}$ is given by $\frac{1}{s+a}$. Therefore, the [[Pierre Simone Laplace|Laplace]] Transform of $e^{-2t}$ can be found by substituting $a = 2$ into this formula.

$$
\begin{gather*} 
F(s) = L\{f(t)\} \\
F(s) = L\{e^{-2t}\} \\
F(s) = \frac{1}{s+2}\\
\end{gather*}
$$

So, the [[Pierre Simone Laplace|Laplace]] Transform of $e^{-2t}$ is $\frac{1}{s+2}$.

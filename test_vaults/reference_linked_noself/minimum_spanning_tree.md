# Minimum Spanning Tree

A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted [[Undirected Graph|undirected graph]] that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. In simpler terms, its a tree formed from a graph where the total weight (or cost) of all the edges in the tree is as small as possible. MSTs are used in network design, including computer networks, telecommunications networks, transportation networks, water supply networks and electrical grids. Algorithms like [[Prim's Algorithm|Prims]] or [[Kruskal's Algorithm|Kruskals]] are often used to find MSTs.

The difference between a Minimum Spanning Tree and a [[Shortest Path Tree|Shortest Path Tree]] is that a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is a subset of a graph that connects all vertices in the graph without any cycles and with the least possible total edge weight. It is typically used to design networks like telecommunication networks, water supply networks, and electrical grids.

On the other hand, a [[Shortest Path Tree|Shortest Path Tree]] in a graph that connects a given source vertex to all other vertices in the graph in the shortest possible way, that is, the total weight of the path from the source to any other vertex is the minimum possible. It is used mostly in routing and transportation problems, the most common example is the GPS, guiding the shortest path from the source to the destination.

# Z-Transform

The Z-Transform is a mathematical process used in signal processing and control systems. Its a technique used for converting discrete time signals, which are naturally sequential, into complex frequency domain representations. By doing this, it allows for easier mathematical manipulation and analysis of the signal. The Z-Transform can be particularly useful in solving linear [[Difference Equations|difference equations]], which frequently occur in digital signal processing. Its comparable to the [[Laplace Transform|Laplace Transform]] but specifically designed for sequences rather than functions of time.

The Z-Transform is generally represented as follows:

$$
\begin{gather*} 
X(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]z^{-n}
\end{gather*}
$$

Where:
- $X(z)$ is the Z-transform of the sequence $x[n]$.
- $z$ is a complex number, and its magnitude must be within a certain region for the sum to converge.
- The summation is over all integer values of $n$.

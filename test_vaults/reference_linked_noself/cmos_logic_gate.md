# [[MOSFET Transistor|CMOS]] Logic Gate

A [[MOSFET Transistor|CMOS]] Logic Gate is a type of digital logic gate that uses Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor ([[MOSFET Transistor|CMOS]]) technology to operate. It is used in many types of electronic products including microprocessors, memory chips, and other digital logic circuits. The main advantage of [[MOSFET Transistor|CMOS]] technology is its low power consumption which makes it ideal for use in battery-powered devices. [[MOSFET Transistor|CMOS]] Logic Gates also have high noise immunity and are highly effective at minimizing current leakage, further enhancing their energy efficiency.

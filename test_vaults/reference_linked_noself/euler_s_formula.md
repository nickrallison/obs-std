# [[Leonhard Euler|Eulers]] Formula

[[Leonhard Euler|Euler’s]] Formula, named after the Swiss mathematician [[Leonhard Euler|Leonhard Euler]], is a beautiful and profound equation in the field of complex analysis, a branch of mathematics. The formula establishes a deep relationship between trigonometry and complex exponential functions.

The formula is stated as: $e^{ix} = \text{cos}(x) + i\text{sin}(x)$, where e is the base of natural logarithms, i is an imaginary unit with the property that $i^2 = -1$, and x is any real number.

This formula shows that its possible to express complex numbers (numbers involving both real and imaginary parts) in terms of trigonometric functions. It also forms the basis for many equations in physics and engineering, particularly those involving waveforms or oscillations.

One of the most famous special cases of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler’s]] Formula is [[Leonhard Euler|Euler’s]] [[Identity Element|Identity]] (Group (Group Theory) Theory): $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$. This [[Identity Element|identity]] combines five of the most important numbers in mathematics — 0, 1, $\pi$, e, and i — into a single simple equation.

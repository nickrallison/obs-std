# [[Voltage|Voltage]] Controlled Oscillator

A [[Voltage|Voltage]] Controlled Oscillator (VCO) is an electronic device that produces oscillations (waveforms) whose frequency is determined by the [[Voltage|voltage]] input. The output frequency can be changed dynamically by varying the input [[Voltage|voltage]]. VCOs are commonly used in synthesizers, telecommunication systems, and other electronic devices to generate signals used for various purposes such as conveying [[Information Theory|information]] or controlling processes.

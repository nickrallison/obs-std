# Nash Equilibrium

Nash Equilibrium is a fundamental concept in the field of game theory. It is a theoretical solution or state in which no player can gain an advantage by unilaterally changing their strategy, assuming the other players keep their strategies unchanged. Named after mathematician John Nash, it represents a situation of optimal strategy for all players involved, where each player's strategy is the best response to the strategies of all other players. It is widely used in economics, computer science, and political science to predict outcomes in a strategic interaction scenario.

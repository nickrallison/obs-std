# Transient Circuit Analysis

Transient circuit analysis is a method used in electrical engineering to determine the behavior of an electric circuit over time during a non-steady state condition. This type of analysis is particularly important when a circuit switches on or off, which can cause temporary surges or drops in [[Voltage|voltage]] or current. These temporary states, known as transients, can potentially damage components if not properly managed. Therefore, understanding and predicting these transients is crucial for the design and operation of reliable electronic systems.

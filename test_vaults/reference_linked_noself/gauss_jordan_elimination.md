# Gauss-Jordan Elimination

Gauss-Jordan elimination is a method used in linear algebra to solve systems of linear equations. It involves the use of elementary row operations on an augmented matrix (formed by appending the coefficients of the variables and the constants in the equations) to achieve a form where the solution to the system is easily identifiable.

The elementary row operations include:

1. Swapping two rows
2. Multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar
3. Adding a multiple of one row to another row

The goal of Gauss-Jordan elimination is to transform the augmented matrix to its reduced row echelon form (RREF). A matrix is in RREF if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. All rows with all zero elements are at the bottom.
2. The leading coefficient (the first non-zero number from the left, also called the pivot) of a non-zero row is always strictly to the right of the pivot of the row above it.
3. All pivots are 1, and each column that contains a pivot has all other entries as zeros.

The Gauss-Jordan elimination process can be summarized as follows:

1. Form the augmented matrix of the system of equations.
2. Use elementary row operations to create a matrix in row echelon form (all zeros below the pivot).
3. Continue with the row operations to achieve reduced row echelon form (all zeros above and below the pivot, and the pivot is 1).
4. The resulting matrix will directly provide the solution to the system.

The Gauss-Jordan method is particularly useful when dealing with systems of equations where the number of equations and the number of unknowns are equal. However, it can also be used for systems where these numbers are not equal, and it can help determine whether the system has no solution, one unique solution, or infinitely many solutions.

Here is an example of Gauss-Jordan elimination:

Consider the system of equations:

1. $x + y + z = 6$
2. $2y + 5z = -4$
3. $2x + 5y - z = 27$

The augmented matrix of this system is:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & 6 \\
0 & 2 & 5 & -4 \\
2 & 5 & -1 & 27
\end{bmatrix}
$$

We can use Gauss-Jordan elimination to solve this system.

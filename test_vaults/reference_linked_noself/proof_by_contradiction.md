# Proof by [[Contradictions|Contradiction]]

Proof by [[Contradictions|contradiction,]] also known as reductio ad absurdum, is a mathematical proof technique that establishes the truth or validity of a proposition by showing that the proposition's being false would imply a [[Contradictions|contradiction.]] This method is used when a proposition is difficult to prove directly, but the negation of the proposition leads to an absurd or impossible conclusion.

The general structure of a proof by [[Contradictions|contradiction]] is as follows:

1. Assume the negation of the proposition we want to prove. This is often referred to as the "contradictory hypothesis" or "assumption of the contrary".
2. From this assumption, derive a sequence of logical deductions.
3. Show that these deductions lead to a [[Contradictions|contradiction,]] i.e., a statement that is patently false or conflicts with a previously established fact or [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]].
4. Conclude that the original assumption (the negation of the proposition) must be false, and therefore, the proposition itself must be true.

Here's a simple example of a proof by contradiction:

**Proposition**: There is no smallest positive rational number.

**Proof**:

1. Assume the contrary, i.e., there exists a smallest positive rational number, say $r$.
2. Consider the number $r/2$. This is a positive rational number (since the quotient of two rational numbers is rational).
3. However, $r/2$ is smaller than $r$, contradicting our assumption that $r$ is the smallest positive rational number.
4. Therefore, our assumption must be false, and the proposition is proven: there is no smallest positive rational number.

Proof by [[Contradictions|contradiction]] is a powerful tool in mathematics and is used in many fundamental proofs, including the irrationality of $\sqrt{2}$, the infinitude of prime numbers, and the incompleteness of formal systems (Gödel's incompleteness theorems).

# [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] Of Determinacy

The [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] of Determinacy (AD) is a principle from the field of set theory, a branch of mathematical logic. It is an alternative to the more commonly used [[Axiom of Choice|Axiom of Choice]]. The AD asserts that in any game of perfect [[Information Theory|information]] involving two players, where moves are chosen from a countable set and play continues for an infinite number of moves, one player must have a winning strategy. However, this [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]] contradicts the [[Axiom of Choice|Axiom of Choice]] and cannot coexist with it in the standard [[Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory|Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory]]. The [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] of Determinacy is often used in descriptive set theory to produce more intuitive results.

## Simple Explanation

The [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] of Determinacy is a rule stating that in a certain type of infinite game ([[Gale Stewart Game|Gale Stewart Game]]), one player always has a winning strategy.

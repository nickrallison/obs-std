# [[MOSFET Transistor|MOSFET Transistor]] Operation Regions

[[MOSFET Transistor|MOSFET Transistor]], or Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect [[Transistor|Transistor,]] operates in three regions: cut-off, triode, and saturation.

1. Cut-off region: Also known as the sub-threshold region, this is where the [[Transistor|transistor]] is off and there's no conduction between the drain and source. The gate-source [[Voltage|voltage]] is less than the threshold [[Voltage|voltage]].

2. Triode region: This region lies between the cut-off and saturation regions. Here, the [[Transistor|transistor]] is on but its conductivity varies based on the gate-source [[Voltage|voltage]]. Its often used for amplification purposes.

3. Saturation region: In this region, the [[Transistor|transistor]] is fully on or saturated and acts like a switch. The current flow doesnt change with varying [[Voltage|voltage]] across drain-source; its controlled by the gate-source [[Voltage|voltage]].

The operation of a [[MOSFET Transistor|MOSFET Transistor]] in these regions determines its functionality as a switch or amplifier in electronic devices.

Example Problem:

Given a [[MOSFET Transistor|MOSFET Transistor]] with a threshold [[Voltage|Voltage]] of 2V, determine the region of operation for the following conditions:

1. Gate-source [[Voltage|voltage]] (Vgs) = 1V, Drain-source [[Voltage|voltage]] (Vds) = 0.5V
2. Gate-source [[Voltage|voltage]] (Vgs) = 3V, Drain-source [[Voltage|voltage]] (Vds) = 1.5V
3. Gate-source [[Voltage|voltage]] (Vgs) = 5V, Drain-source [[Voltage|voltage]] (Vds) = 4.5V

Solution:

$$
\begin{gather*} 
\text{For the first condition:}\\
\text{Since Vgs < threshold [[Voltage.md|voltage,]] the MOSFET is in the cut-off region.}\\
\\
\text{For the second condition:}\\
\text{Since Vgs > threshold [[Voltage.md|voltage]] and Vds < Vgs - threshold voltage,}\\
\text{the MOSFET is in the triode region.}\\
\\
\text{For the third condition:}\\
\text{Since Vgs > threshold [[Voltage.md|voltage]] and Vds > Vgs - threshold voltage,}\\
\text{the MOSFET is in the saturation region.}
\end{gather*}
$$

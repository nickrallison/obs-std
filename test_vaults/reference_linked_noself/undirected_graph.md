# Undirected Graph

An undirected graph is a type of graph in which the edges do not have a direction. This means that the edges are bidirectional and the connection between two nodes or vertices goes both ways. In other words, if there is an edge between two nodes A and B, it implies that A is connected to B and B is also connected to A. This type of graph is commonly used in scenarios where relationships between pairs are mutual, such as social networks where if person A is a friend of person B, then person B is also a friend of person A.

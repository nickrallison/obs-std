# Binary To [[Canonical Signed Digit|CSD]] Conversion

Binary to [[Canonical Signed Digit|Canonical Signed Digit]] ([[Canonical Signed Digit|CSD]]) conversion is a process used in digital signal processing. It helps to reduce the complexity of multiplication by converting binary numbers into a form that requires fewer addition operations. The [[Canonical Signed Digit|CSD]] representation uses three digits: 0, 1, and -1. This conversion not only simplifies calculations but also saves power and resources in digital systems.

```pseudo
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Binary To [[Canonical Signed Digit.md|Canonical Signed Digit]] Conversion}
\begin{algorithmic}
  \Procedure{BinaryToCSD}{$binary$}
	\State Initialize an empty list, $csd$, to store the [[Canonical Signed Digit.md|Canonical Signed Digits]]
	\State Initialize a variable, $carry$, to 0
	\For{each bit $b$ in $binary$ from right to left}
	    \State Calculate $sum \gets b + carry$
	    \If{$sum$ is equal to 0 or 1} 
		  \State Append $sum$ to the beginning of $csd$
		  \State Set $carry$ to 0
		\ElsIf{$sum$ is equal to -1 or 2} 
		  \State Append 0 to the beginning of $csd$
		  \State Set $carry$ to the sign of $sum$
		\EndIf
	  \EndFor
	  \If{$carry$ is not equal to 0} 
	    \State Append $carry$ to the beginning of $csd$
	  \EndIf
	  \State return [[Canonical Signed Digit.md|csd]] as a string joined with no spaces between digits.
  \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

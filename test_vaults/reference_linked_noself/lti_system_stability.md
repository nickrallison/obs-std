# [[Linear Time Invarient Systems|LTI]] System Stability

[[Linear Time Invarient Systems|Linear Time-Invariant]] ([[Linear Time Invarient Systems|LTI]]) system stability is a concept in signal processing and control theory. It refers to the ability of a system to produce bounded output for a given bounded input. In other words, a stable [[Linear Time Invarient Systems|LTI]] system doesn't amplify the input signal's magnitude and doesn't generate an output if there's no input. 

Stability can be determined through various methods such as [[Bode Plot|Bode plots]], Nyquist plots, or evaluating the roots of the system's characteristic equation. In particular, if all poles of an [[Linear Time Invarient Systems|LTI]] system lie in the left half of the complex plane (for continuous-time systems) or inside the unit circle (for discrete-time systems), then the system is considered stable. 

Understanding [[Linear Time Invarient Systems|LTI]] system stability is crucial in many fields including electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and economics because it helps determine whether a given system will behave as expected or potentially fail.

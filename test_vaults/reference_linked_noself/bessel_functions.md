# Bessel Functions

The Bessel function is used in computing the spectra of [[Frequency Modulation|FM]] modulated signals. Wherein the equation of the spectrum is given by

$$
F(f) = \sum^\infty_{n=-\infty}\frac{A_c}{2}J_n(\beta)[\delta(f+(f_c+nf_m)) + \delta(f-(f_c+nf_m))]
$$
Where $J_n$ is the bessel function, and $\beta$ is the modulation index , the amplitude of the carrier signal is represented by $A_c$ and the frequency of the carrier signal is denoted as $f_c$.

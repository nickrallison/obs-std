# Vector Space

A vector space, also known as a linear space, is a fundamental concept in mathematics, particularly in the field of linear algebra. It is a collection of objects called vectors, which can be added together and multiplied by scalars (real or complex numbers). Vector spaces are subject to ten specific [[Mathematical Axioms|axioms]], including [[Commutativity|commutativity]], [[Associativity|associativity]], and [[Distributivity|distributivity]] of vector addition and scalar multiplication. Examples of vector spaces include sets of numbers, functions, polynomials, and matrices. They are used in various fields such as physics, computer science, and engineering for modeling phenomena and solving problems.

## [[Mathematical Axioms|Axioms]]

The [[Mathematical Axioms|axioms]] of a vector space are the rules that define how these operations of addition and scalar multiplication behave. These [[Mathematical Axioms|axioms]] are the basic properties that all vector spaces must satisfy. They are the foundation upon which the entire theory of vector spaces is built.

There are eight [[Mathematical Axioms|axioms]] in total. Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. [[Associativity|Associativity]] of Addition: This [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]] states that the way vectors are grouped in an addition operation doesn't change the result. In other words, if you have three vectors a, b, and c, then (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).

2. [[Commutativity|Commutativity]] of Addition: This [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]] states that the order in which vectors are added doesn't change the result. So, for any two vectors a and b, a + b = b + a.

3. [[Identity Element|Identity Element]] of Addition: This [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]] states that there exists an element 0 in the vector space such that for every vector v, v + 0 = v.

4. [[Inverse Element|Inverse Elements]] of Addition: This [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]] states that for every vector v, there exists an element -v such that v + (-v) = 0.

5. Compatibility of Scalar Multiplication with Field Multiplication: This [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]] states that for any two scalars a and b and any vector v, a * (b * v) = (a * b) * v.

6. [[Identity Element|Identity Element]] of Scalar Multiplication: This [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]] states that for every vector v, 1 * v = v where 1 is the multiplicative [[Identity Element|Identity]] (Group Theory)|identity in the field.

7. [[Distributivity|Distributivity]] of Scalar Multiplication with respect to Vector Addition: This [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]] states that for any scalar a and any vectors u and v, a * (u + v) = a * u + a * v.

8. [[Distributivity|Distributivity]] of Scalar Multiplication with respect to Scalar Addition: This [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]] states that for any scalars a and b and any vector v, (a + b) * v = a * v + b * v.

These [[Mathematical Axioms|axioms]] provide the structure needed to study concepts such as linear combinations, linear [[Independence (Statistics)|independence]], basis, dimension, linear transformations, [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] and [[Eigenvectors|eigenvectors]] in more advanced topics in linear algebra.

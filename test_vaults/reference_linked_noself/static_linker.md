# Static [[Linker|Linker]]

A static linker, also known as a [[Statically Linked Library.md|static link editor,]]linkeditor,is a program in a system's software development toolkit that combines one or more object files[[Object Files.md| generated by ]]   compiler into a single executable program. 

The process of static linking involves resolving symbol references, which are essentially placeholders for memory addresses. Each symbol reference in an object file corresponds to a function or a variable that is defined in the same or another object file. The static [[Linker.md|linker]] replaces each symbol reference with an actual memory address. 

The static [[Linker.md|linker]] also combines all the sections of similar types across different [[Object Files.md|object files ]]filesinto[[Object Files.md|a single section]]singlesectionin the executable. For example, all '.text' sections (which contain machine code) from different object files[[Object Files.md| are combined]]   Files.md| a single ]]   section in the executable. 

The main advantage of static linking is that the resulting executable is self-contained and can be run on any system without requiring any additional libraries. This is because all library routines used by the program are included within the executable itself. However, this also leads to larger executable sizes and lack of sharing of common library code across different executables.

The process of static linking can be summarized by the following steps:

1. Symbol resolution: The [[Linker.md|linker]] maps each symbol reference to a unique symbol definition from the symbol tables of the input object files.
2. Relocation: The [[Linker.md|linker]] updates the addresses of symbols and instructions that refer to these symbols, based on where the [[Linker.md|linker]] places the program sections in the executable.
3. Section merging and allocation: The [[Linker.md|linker]] combines sections of the same type from different object files and [[Object Files.md|allocates them ]]themcontiguous[[Object Files.md|blocks of space]]ofspacein the executable.
4. Writing the executable: The [[Linker.md|linker]] writes out the executable file, including the headers, section contents, and symbol table.

The mathematical aspect of static linking involves address calculations during the relocation step. For each symbol reference, the [[Linker.md|linker]] computes the actual memory address based on the[[Pointer.md| relative address]]   the symbol ]]   its section and the starting address of the section in the executable. This can be represented by the following formula:

$$
\text{Actual Address} = \text{Relative Address} + \text{Section Start Address}
$$

# Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' Theorem is a fundamental concept in the field of statistics and probability. Named after Thomas Bayes, who first provided an equation that allows new evidence to update beliefs, it serves as the foundation for a range of statistical techniques, including Bayesian inference.

In simple terms, Bayes' Theorem is a mathematical formula used for calculating conditional probabilities. It describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

The theorem is often symbolized as
$$
\text{P}(A|B) = \frac{\text{P}(B|A)\text{P}(A)}{\text{P}(B)}
$$Here, P(A|B) represents the probability of event A given event B is true. P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A is true. P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of observing A and B independently of each other.

This theorem has wide applications in fields like machine learning, artificial intelligence, quality control, medical testing and weather prediction among others. It's especially useful when making decisions with incomplete information or predicting future events based on current data.

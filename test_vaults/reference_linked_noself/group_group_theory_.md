# Group (Group Theory)

In mathematics, a group is a set equipped with an operation that combines any two of its elements to form a third element in such a way that four conditions called group [[Mathematical Axioms|axioms]] are satisfied. These conditions are:

[[Closure|Closure]] (the result of the operation always remains within the set),  
[[Associativity|Associativity]] (the defined operation is [[Associativity|associative]]),  
[[Identity Element|Identity]] (Group Theory) (Group Theory) (there exists an [[Identity Element|identity element]] that, when combined with any element, leaves the element unchanged), and  
[[Invertability|Invertability]] (for each element, there exists an inverse). 

Group theory is the study of these groups and their properties. It is a fundamental concept in many areas of mathematics such as geometry, algebra, and number theory.

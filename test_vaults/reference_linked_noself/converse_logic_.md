# Converse (Logic)

In logic, the term "converse" refers to a type of statement that is formed by reversing the order of the components in a given conditional statement. For example, if the original statement is "If it is raining, then I will carry an umbrella," the converse would be "If I [[Amplitude Modulation|am]] carrying an umbrella, then it is raining." It's important to note that the truth of a statement does not necessarily guarantee the truth of its converse.

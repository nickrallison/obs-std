# Operational Amplifiers

Operational amplifiers, often known as op-amps, are high-gain electronic [[Voltage|voltage]] amplifiers with a differential input and typically a single-ended output. They are used in a wide range of applications, including signal conditioning, filtering, mathematical operations and analog-to-digital conversion. The high gain feature allows the op-amp to amplify weak input signals. The differential input means that the amplifier amplifies the difference between the [[Voltage|voltages]] applied to its two input terminals. This makes it useful in applications where it's necessary to eliminate common-mode signals such as noise or interference.

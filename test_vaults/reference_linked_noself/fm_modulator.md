# [[Frequency Modulation|FM]] Modulator

An [[Frequency Modulation|FM]] modulator, or frequency modulator, is a device that changes the frequency of a carrier wave in accordance with the signal being sent. This process is known as [[Frequency Modulation|frequency modulation]]. The modulator varies the carrier waves frequency in direct proportion to changes in the [[Voltage|voltage]] level of the signal. [[Frequency Modulation|FM]] modulators are commonly used in radio and television broadcasting, as well as in telecommunications and signal processing systems. They allow for the transmission of [[Information Theory|information]] over long distances with minimal loss of quality.

The circuit that modulates an [[Frequency Modulation|FM]] signal is composed of a frequency modulator. This device changes the frequency of the carrier wave in proportion to the instantaneous value of the message signal. It typically includes components such as oscillators, amplifiers, and filters.

## Example

Lets consider a simple [[Frequency Modulation|FM]] modulator where the carrier wave frequency is 100 MHz and the maximum frequency deviation is 75 kHz. If the message signal is a sine wave with a frequency of 15 kHz and a peak [[Voltage|voltage]] of 3 volts, what will be the modulation index?

Solution:  
The modulation index (Î²) for an [[Frequency Modulation|FM]] signal is given by the formula:

$$
\begin{gather*} 
\beta = \frac{\Delta f}{f_m} \newline
\text{where,} \newline
\Delta f = \text{maximum frequency deviation} \newline
f_m = \text{frequency of modulating signal} \newline
\end{gather*}
$$

Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:

$$
\begin{gather*} 
\beta = \frac{75 kHz}{15 kHz} \newline
\beta = 5.0 \newline
\end{gather*}
$$

So, the modulation index for this [[Frequency Modulation|FM]] modulator is 5.0.

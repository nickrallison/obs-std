# Application Binary Interface

An Application Binary Interface(ABI) is a set of rules and standards for interacting with a computer's operating system or sometimes with other runtime environments. This interface bridges the gap between high-level code and the low-level hardware operations that perform tasks on a computer's processor.

## Purpose of ABIs
The main purpose of an ABI is to ensure compatibility between pieces of binary code�typically executables and libraries�that need to interact in a system. It achieves this by specifying details such as:

- **Data Type Size and Alignment:** Ensures that the program understands the size of different data types and their proper alignment in memory. This is crucial for performance as misaligned data may lead to penalties during CPU processing.

- **Calling Conventions:** Dictates how functions receive parameters from and return values to the caller. This includes rules about which registers to use for passing arguments and how the stack should be managed.

- **Register Use:** Describes which registers are preserved across function calls and which can be overwritten. 

- **System Call Interface:** Specifies how to perform system calls, which are requests for services from the operating system. This might involve setting up registers with specific values followed by a software interrupt or another mechanism like a syscall instruction.

## Importance in Software Development
In software development, especially in C and other low-level programming languages, adhering to an ABI is essential when creating code that needs to interact directly with the operating system or when different components of a system need to reliably work together. For example, when developing a library, adherence to the ABI ensures that programs which use the library can successfully run without encountering binary compatibility issues.

## Impact on Cross-Platform Development
ABIs are platform-specific, meaning that software compiled for one type of system (like x86-64) might not work on another type (like ARM) without modification. This presents challenges in cross-platform development, where software is intended to be executable across multiple hardware architectures. Developers often need to compile their software separately for each target architecture, ensuring compliance with each architecture's ABI.

## ABI Stability
ABIs can be either stable or unstable. A stable ABI allows software compiled for a particular version of an ABI to run on later versions without modification. This stability is crucial for certain applications where software needs to operate over extended periods without recompilation. Operating systems like Linux try to maintain a stable ABI for kernel-space to user-space interactions to ensure that drivers and other system-level components continue to function across different [[Kernel.md|kernel]] versions.

## Summary
Understanding and conforming to the correct ABI is essential for developers working at the intersection of hardware and software. Proper adherence to ABI standards ensures that applications can function efficiently and interact seamlessly with different system components, enhancing portability, and maintaining binary compatibility across different system versions and platforms.

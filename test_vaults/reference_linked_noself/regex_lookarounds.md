# [[RegEx|Regex]] Lookarounds

[[RegEx|Regex]] Lookarounds are powerful tools in [[Regular Expression|regular expressions]] that allow you to match a certain pattern only if it is preceded or followed by another pattern. They do not consume characters in the string, but only assert whether a match is possible or not. There are four types of lookarounds: positive lookaheads, negative lookaheads, positive lookbehinds and negative lookbehinds. Positive lookaheads assert that certain characters follow the current position, while negative lookaheads assert that certain characters do not follow the current position. Similarly, positive lookbehinds assert that certain characters precede the current position, while negative lookbehinds assert that certain characters do not precede the current position.

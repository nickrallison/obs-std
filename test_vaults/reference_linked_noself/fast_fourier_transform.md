# Fast [[Fourier Transform|Fourier Transform]]

This is an algorithm by which the [[Discrete Fourier Transform|DFT]] is calculated.

Runs in [[Big-O Notation|big-o]] of $\Theta(nlog(n))$

By choosing special sinusoids to compare the signal with, there will be repeated multiplications which can be taken advantage of to speed up the algorithm.

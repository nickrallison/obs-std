# Sum of [[Random Variable|Random Variables]]

When [[Random Variable|random variables]] are summed together the resulting [[Random Variable|random variable]] can be represented as a probability distribution of the [[Convolution|convolution]] of the individual elements. The distribution of this sum will depend on the distributions of the individual variables being added. For instance, if two or more independent [[Random Variable|random variables]] have normal (Gaussian) distributions, their sum will also have a [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]].

The formula for the probability distribution is the [[Convolution|convolution]] of the individual [[Random Variable|random variableâ€™s]] probability distribution

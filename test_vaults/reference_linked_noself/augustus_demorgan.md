# Augustus Demorgan

Augustus De Morgan was a British mathematician and logician who made significant contributions to the field of mathematics. He was born in Madurai, India on June 27, 1806 and passed away in London, England on March 18, 1871.  
De Morgan attended Trinity College, Cambridge where he excelled in mathematics and graduated in 1827. After graduation, he became a professor at the newly founded University of London (now University College London), where he served as the first professor of mathematics from 1828 until his resignation in 1831 due to a dispute over religious tests for professors. He later returned to the university in 1836 and remained there until his second resignation in 1866.  
De Morgan is best known for his work on logic and probability. He formulated De Morgan's laws which are fundamental principles of modern [[Truth Functional Logic|propositional logic]]. His work also laid the groundwork for set theory, a fundamental theory in mathematics which studies collections of objects.  
In addition to his work on logic and set theory, De Morgan made important contributions to calculus including standardizing and improving notation. He also wrote extensively on the history of mathematics.  
He was one of the founders of the London Mathematical Society and served as its first president from 1865-1866. In addition, he wrote several books on mathematics including "A Budget of Paradoxes", a compilation of mathematical problems and puzzles along with their solutions.  
Despite facing partial blindness throughout his life due to congenital cataract, De Morgan's impact on the field of mathematics and logic make him one of the notable figures in these fields during the nineteenth century.

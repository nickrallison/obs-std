# Modus Ponens

Modus Ponens is a form of deductive reasoning in logic, often used in proofs. It is a valid argument form that states if a certain condition is true, then another condition will also be true. It's structured as follows: "If P, then Q. P is true, therefore Q must be true." For example, if it's raining (P), the ground will be wet (Q). If it's confirmed that it's raining (P is true), we can deduce that the ground is wet (Q must be true). This is one of the rules of [[Natural Deduction|Natural Deduction]].

$$
\begin{gather*} 
\text{If } P \text{ then } Q. \\
P \text{ is true}, \\
\therefore Q \text{ must be true}.
\end{gather*}
$$

# Quantum [[Bogo Sort|Bogo Sort]]

Is [[Big-O Notation|time complexity]] O(1). Here is how it works:

1. Quantumly randomize the list, such that there is no way of knowing what order the list is in until it is observed. This will divide the universe into O(n!) universes; however, the division has no cost, as it happens constantly anyway.
2. If the list is not sorted, destroy the universe. (This operation is left as an exercise to the reader.)
3. All remaining universes contain lists which are sorted.

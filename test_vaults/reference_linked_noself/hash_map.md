# Hash Map

A Hash Map, also known as a Hash Table, is a data structure that implements an [[Associativity|associative]] array abstract data type. It uses a [[Hash Function|hash function]] to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. The main advantage of hash maps over other table lookup structures is its speed. This efficiency comes at a cost: the hash tables are not sorted and do not allow for efficient traversal of items in order (though they can be made to do so with some additional work). They are widely used in many kinds of computer software, particularly for [[Associativity|associative]] arrays, database indexing, [[Caching|caches]], and sets.

Hash Maps are useful in many areas you would perhaps not expect like sorting with [[Radix Sort|Radix Sort]] and many other optimized algorithms.

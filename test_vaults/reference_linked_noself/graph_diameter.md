# Graph Diameter

The graph diameter, in the field of graph theory, refers to the longest of all the calculated shortest paths in a graph. In simpler terms, it's the greatest distance between any two vertices in the graph. This measure helps to understand the layout and connectivity of a graph. A small diameter indicates that nodes are closely connected, while a large diameter suggests a sparser connection amongst nodes. 

This is a similar way to characterize a graph to something like a [[Minimum Spanning Tree|Minimum Spanning Tree]] or a [[Shortest Path Tree|Shortest Path Tree]].

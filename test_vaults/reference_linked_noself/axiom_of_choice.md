# [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] Of Choice

The [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] of Choice is a fundamental principle in mathematical set theory. It states that, given any collection of bins, each containing at least one item, it is possible to make a selection of exactly one item from each bin. This [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]] is used in many areas of mathematics to deal with questions about the existence of certain mathematical objects or structures. However, it's also known for leading to counterintuitive results, like the [[Banach Tarski Paradox|Banach-Tarski paradox]]. Despite this, it is widely accepted and used by mathematicians.

The [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] of Choice is more of a principle or an assumption rather than a mathematical theorem or formula, hence it doesn't have a proof or a formula. However, it can be represented symbolically in set theory as follows:

Given any set X of nonempty sets, there exists a choice function f defined on X such that for every set Y in X, f(Y) is an element of Y

$$
\forall X (\emptyset \notin X \Rightarrow \exists f : X \to \bigcup X, \forall Y \in X (f(Y) \in Y))
$$

## Simple Explanation

The [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] of Choice simply means that if you have a collection of boxes, each with at least one item inside, you can always pick one item from each box.

# [[Heap Data Structure|Heap]] Property

A [[Heap Data Structure|heap]] is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the [[Heap Data Structure|heap]] property. This property can be of two types: 

1. **Max-Heap**: For any given node I, the value of I is greater than or equal to the values of its children. This property must be recursively true for all nodes in the [[Heap Data Structure|Heap]] Data Structure.md|Binary Heap]].
2. **Min-Heap**: For any given node I, the value of I is less than or equal to the values of its children. This property must be recursively true for all nodes in the [[Heap Data Structure|Heap]] Data Structure.md|Binary Heap]].

In a [[Heap Data Structure|heap]], the highest (max-heap) or lowest (min-heap) element is always at the "root" of the tree. [[Heap Data Structure|Heaps]] are crucial in several efficient graph algorithms such as [[Dijkstra's Algorithm|Dijkstra's algorithm]], and in the sorting algorithm [[Heap Sort|Heapsort]].

A [[Heap Data Structure|heap]] is not a sorted structure and can be regarded as partially ordered. There is no particular relationship among nodes on any given level, even among the siblings. 

When a [[Heap Data Structure|heap]] is a complete [[Binary Tree|binary tree]], it has a smallest possible heightâ€”a [[Heap Data Structure|heap]] with N nodes and for each node a branches always has log<sub>a</sub>N height. As such, it is very memory efficient.

The [[Heap Data Structure|heap data structure]] provides efficient implementations of [[Heap Data Structure|heap]] operations like extract-min, extract-max, delete-min, delete-max, insert, decrease-key, and merge. 

Here are the time complexities for various operations in a [[Heap Data Structure|Heap]] Data Structure.md|Binary Heap]]:

- [[Heap Data Structure|Heap]] Data Structure.md|Binary Heap]] Construction: $O(n)$
- Extract-Max in Max [[Heap Data Structure|Heap]] or Extract-Min in Min [[Heap Data Structure|Heap]]: $O(\log n)$
- Decrease-Key in Max [[Heap Data Structure|Heap]] or Increase-Key in Min [[Heap Data Structure|Heap]]: $O(\log n)$
- Insert: $O(\log n)$
- Delete: $O(\log n)$

The [[Heap Data Structure|heap]] property is maintained after each operation, ensuring the structure remains a [[Heap Data Structure|heap]].

## [[Introduction to Algorithms 4e.pdf]] - Pages 186-188 Summary

Chapter 6 of the document primarily delves into the concept of [[Heap Sort|heapsort]], starting with a comprehensive discussion of several questions related to max-heaps. The nature of the root node in a subtree, the probable location of the smallest element in a max-heap, and the possible levels at which the kth largest element might dwell in a max-heap are among the topics under investigation. The chapter also introduces the seemingly paradoxical question of whether a sorted array can be considered a min-heap and then challenges it further by presenting an example array, questioning its qualification as a max-heap.

The chapter further progressing, introduces the pivotal procedure known as MAX-HEAPIFY designed to maintain the max-heap property. With an array 'A' with the heap-size attribute and an index 'i' as inputs, the MAX-HEAPIFY presumes that the [[Binary Tree|binary trees]] with roots at LEFT.i/ and RIGHT.i/ already maintain the max-heaps. This procedure then corrects any possible violation of the max-heap property by moving the smaller element down the max-heap, ensuring that the subtree rooted at index i holds true to the max-heap property.

The chapter comes to a constructive conclusion by providing pseudocode for the MAX-HEAPIFY procedure, giving readers valuable insight into its implementation. The chapter thus curated provides an expansive understanding of [[Heap Sort|heapsort]] and the mechanism to maintain max-heap property.

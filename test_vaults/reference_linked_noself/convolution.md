# Convolution

Convolution is a mathematical operation that is fundamental to many areas of both pure and applied mathematics. In the context of signal processing and data analysis, convolution is a kind of 'smearing' or 'blurring' operation, where one function gets spread out across another. It's often used in image and signal processing to apply filters, in statistics to calculate moving [[Expected Value|averages]], and in machine learning for convolutional neural networks.

In simple terms, convolution involves two functions producing a third function that expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other. The term 'convolution' refers to the way we combine these two functions to obtain a third function. It's like blending two things together to get a new thing, where the output is influenced by both inputs.

In practical applications like image processing, convolution can be used for operations such as edge detection or blur by applying a filter (also known as a [[kernel.md|kernel]]) across an image. This filter is moved across the entire image, applying a mathematical calculation at each point to transform the image.

In machine learning and specifically in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), convolution plays an essential role. CNNs use convolution in their first layer to extract features from input like images. These features are then used for tasks such as image classification or object detection.

So, in essence, convolution is an important mathematical tool that helps us combine different functions or data sets together in a meaningful way.

The concept of convolution can be written in LaTeX as follows:

$$
\begin{gather*} 
(f * g)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau)g(t - \tau)d\tau
\end{gather*}
$$

This formula represents the convolution of two functions $f$ and $g$. The symbol $*$ denotes the convolution operation. The variable $\tau$ is a dummy variable for integration. The integral is taken over all real numbers, from negative infinity to positive infinity.

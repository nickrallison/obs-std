# Gradient

In calculus, a gradient is a vector operation that produces a [[Vector Field|vector field]], representing the maximum rate of change of a function at each point. It's essentially the slope of the function at any given point. The direction of the gradient vector is the direction in which the function increases most quickly, while its magnitude indicates the rate of increase in that direction. Gradient is an important concept in fields like physics and engineering where it can be used to describe physical quantities such as temperature or pressure changes.

The gradient of a scalar function $f(x, y, z)$ in three dimensions is given by:

$$
\begin{gather*} 
\nabla f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \mathbf{i} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \mathbf{j} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \mathbf{k}
\end{gather*}
$$

Where $\nabla$ is the del operator, $\mathbf{i}$, $\mathbf{j}$ and $\mathbf{k}$ are the unit vectors in the x, y and z directions respectively, and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$, $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}$ are the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to $x$, $y$ and $z$.

Let's consider a function $f(x, y, z) = x^2y - z^3$. We want to find the gradient of this function.

The gradient is given by $\nabla f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\mathbf{i} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\mathbf{j} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\mathbf{k}$.

So we first need to find the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$.

$$
\begin{gather*} 
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2xy \\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x^2 \\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = -3z^2\\
\end{gather*}
$$

Substituting these into the formula for the gradient gives:

$$
\nabla f = 2xy \mathbf{i} + x^2 \mathbf{j} - 3z^2 \mathbf{k}
$$

So the gradient of the function $f(x, y, z) = x^2y - z^3$ is $\nabla f = 2xy \mathbf{i} + x^2 \mathbf{j} - 3z^2 \mathbf{k}$.

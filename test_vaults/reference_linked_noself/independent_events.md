# Independent Events

Independent events are a fundamental concept in probability theory. Two events, A and B, are said to be independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the occurrence of the other. In other words, the events have no influence on each other. 

Mathematically, this is expressed as:

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)
$$

where $P(A \cap B)$ is the probability of both A and B occurring, $P(A)$ is the probability of A occurring, and $P(B)$ is the probability of B occurring. If this equation holds, then A and B are independent.

This concept can be extended to more than two events. A set of events is said to be independent if the probability of the [[Intersection|intersection]] of any number of those events equals the product of their probabilities. 

For example, for three events A, B, and C, they are independent if:

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)
$$
$$
P(A \cap C) = P(A)P(C)
$$
$$
P(B \cap C) = P(B)P(C)
$$
$$
P(A \cap B \cap C) = P(A)P(B)P(C)
$$

If these equations hold, then A, B, and C are independent.

A related concept is [[Conditional Probability|conditional probability]], which is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. If A and B are independent, then the [[Conditional Probability|conditional probability]] of A given B is simply the probability of A, and vice versa. This is expressed as:

$$
P(A|B) = P(A)
$$
$$
P(B|A) = P(B)
$$

where $P(A|B)$ is the probability of A given B, and $P(B|A)$ is the probability of B given A.

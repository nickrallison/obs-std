# Continuity

Continuity is a fundamental concept in calculus and real analysis. It describes the behavior of functions in a way that intuitively corresponds to our notion of a function without "breaks" or "jumps". 

A function $f(x)$ is said to be continuous at a point $x=a$ if the following three conditions are met:

1. $f(a)$ is defined.
2. $\lim_{{x \to a}} f(x)$ exists.
3. $\lim_{{x \to a}} f(x) = f(a)$.

In mathematical notation, this is often written as:

$$
\lim_{{x \to a}} f(x) = f(a)
$$

This definition can be extended to say that a function is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every point in that interval.

A function that is continuous at every point in its domain is simply called a continuous function. Examples of continuous functions include polynomial functions, exponential functions, and sine and cosine functions.

The concept of continuity is closely related to the concept of a limit. The limit of a function as $x$ approaches a value $a$ is the value that the function approaches as $x$ gets arbitrarily close to $a$. If the function actually reaches this value when $x=a$, then the function is continuous at $a$.

Continuity has many important implications in calculus and analysis. For example, the Intermediate Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$, and $k$ is any value between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there exists a value $c$ in $[a, b]$ such that $f(c) = k$. This theorem relies on the concept of continuity.

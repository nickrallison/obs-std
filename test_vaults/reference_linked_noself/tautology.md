# Tautology

A tautology is a statement or proposition that is always true, regardless of whether the individual components within the statement are true or false. It is a concept in logic and rhetoric, often used to emphasize a point or idea. In logic, a tautology is a formula or assertion that is true in every possible interpretation. In rhetoric, it refers to a phrase or statement that essentially says the same thing twice, often in different words, and is therefore redundant.

# Closure

In group theory, a branch of abstract algebra, closure is a fundamental concept that refers to the property of a set where the result of combining any two elements in the set is always an element within the same set. This means that if you perform an operation (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) on any two elements in a set, the result will always be a member of that set. For example, the set of all integers is closed under addition because adding any two integers always results in another integer. Closure is one of the four key properties (along with [[Associativity|associativity]], [[Identity Element|identity element]], and [[Inverse Element|inverse element]]) that define a mathematical group.

The closure property in group theory doesn't have a specific formula like in your example, but it can be expressed in general terms like this:

Let $G$ be a group and $*$ be a [[Binary Operation|binary operation]] on $G$. If for every pair of elements $a, b \in G$, the result of the operation $a * b$ is also in $G$, then we say that G is closed under the operation. This can be written as:

$$
\forall a, b \in G : a * b \in G
$$

This means that if you take any two elements from the group and perform the operation, the result will always belong to the same group.

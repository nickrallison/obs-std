# Path Finding Algorithms

Path finding algorithms are computational procedures used in artificial intelligence and robotics to determine the shortest route or path between two points. These algorithms are crucial in various applications such as GPS navigation systems, network routing, games, and virtual simulations. Some common examples of path finding algorithms include [[Dijkstra's Algorithm|Dijkstras Algorithm]], A* ([[A-Star Search|A Star]]) Algorithm, [[Bellman-Ford Algorithm|Bellman-Ford Algorithm]], and Floyd-Warshall Algorithm. These algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses depending on the complexity of the problem and the specific requirements of the task.

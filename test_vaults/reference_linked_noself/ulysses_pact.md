# Ulysses Pact

The Ulysses Pact, also known as a commitment device, is a freely made decision that is designed to bind oneself to a future course of action. It's named after the Greek hero Ulysses (or Odysseus) who had his sailors tie him to the mast of his ship so that he could resist the sirens' enchanting song, as told in Homer's Odyssey.

In behavioral economics, a Ulysses pact is a strategy that people use to overcome self-control problems that stem from time-inconsistent preferences. Time-inconsistent preferences occur when the value that a person assigns to a reward changes depending on when the reward is to be received. For example, a person might prefer to receive $100 today rather than $110 tomorrow, but prefer to receive $110 in 31 days rather than $100 in 30 days. This is inconsistent because the delay and the increase in reward are the same in both cases.

The Ulysses pact can be modeled using the framework of intertemporal choice. Intertemporal choices involve decisions about different outcomes that occur at different points in time. The standard model of intertemporal choice is the discounted utility model, which can be represented by the following equation:

$$ U = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \frac{u(c_t)}{(1+\rho)^t} $$

where $U$ is the total utility, $u(c_t)$ is the utility from consumption at time $t$, $\rho$ is the discount rate, and $T$ is the time horizon.

A Ulysses pact changes the decision-making process by adding a commitment that affects the utility from future consumption. This can be represented by modifying the utility function to include a penalty for not following the commitment. For example, if the commitment is to exercise every day, the utility function could be modified to include a negative term for days when exercise does not occur.

The Ulysses pact is related to several other concepts in behavioral economics. One is the idea of present bias, which is the tendency to give stronger weight to payoffs that are closer to the present time when considering trade-offs between two future moments. Another is the concept of hyperbolic discounting, which is a time-inconsistent model of discounting.

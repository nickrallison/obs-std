# Necessary Truths & Falsehoods

Necessary truths and falsehoods are statements that cannot be any other way but true or false, respectively. They are considered to be logically necessary and their opposite would be a [[Proof by Contradiction|logical contradiction]]. For example, "All cats are animals" is a necessary truth because it is impossible for all cats to not be animals. On the other hand, "The sun is starry and a planet" is a necessary falsehood because it is contradictory

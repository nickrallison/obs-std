# [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] Of Pairing

The [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] of Pairing is a fundamental concept in set theory, a branch of mathematical logic. It basically states that for any two sets, there is a set that contains them both as elements. This [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]] allows the formation of pairs of objects and it's one of the foundational [[Mathematical Axioms|axioms]] in the [[Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory|Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]]. It permits the construction of new sets from existing ones, facilitating mathematical proofs and operations.

## Simple Explanation

The [[Mathematical Axioms|Axiom]] of Pairing is a rule in set theory that says you can always make a new set from the [[Union|union]] of any two existing sets.

# Truth Functional Logic

Truth Functional Logic, also known as propositional logic, is a branch of symbolic logic that deals with the relationships between propositions or statements. It uses logical operators to combine simple propositions into complex ones and assigns truth values (true or false) to them based on the truth values of their components. The key concept in truth functional logic is that the truth value of a complex statement depends solely on the truth values of its parts, not on their meaning. This allows for systematic analysis and reasoning about logical relationships and arguments.

Here is an example of a truth-functional logic problem:

Let's consider the following propositional logic statement:

P: "If it is raining, then John will stay at home."

This can be symbolized as follows: R → J

Where:  
R: It is raining  
J: John will stay at home

We are asked to find the truth value of P given that R is true and J is false.

In propositional logic, an implication (→) is false only when the antecedent (the part before the arrow) is true and the consequent (the part after the arrow) is false. In all other cases, it's true.

So, we can solve this problem as follows:

$$
\begin{gather*} 
R \rightarrow J \\
T \rightarrow F \\
F\\
\end{gather*}
$$

So, P: "If it is raining, then John will stay at home." is False given that "It is raining" is True and "John will stay at home" is False.

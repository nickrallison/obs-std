# Alan Turing

Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23, 1912, in London. He is widely considered as the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Turing studied mathematics at King's College, University of Cambridge, where he developed the concept of a "universal machine" that could compute anything that is [[Computability|computable]]. This idea formed the basis of all modern computers.  
During World War II, Turing worked at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre, and was instrumental in breaking the German Enigma code. His work is said to have significantly shortened the war and saved countless lives.  
Post war, Turing worked on developing an early computer at the National Physical Laboratory and later on artificial intelligence at the University of Manchester. He proposed an experiment now known as the "Turing Test" to determine if a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to or indistinguishable from human behavior.  
Despite his accomplishments, Turing faced persecution for his homosexuality - which was illegal in Britain at that time. He was convicted for "gross indecency" in 1952 and underwent chemical castration as an alternative to prison. Tragically, this led to his untimely death by suicide on June 7, 1954.  
In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous royal pardon. His legacy continues through the "Turing Award", often referred to as the 'Nobel Prize' of computing world which is given annually by ACM (Association for Computing Machinery). In addition, his life and work have been depicted in various forms including the 2014 film "The Imitation Game".

# Frequency Response

Frequency response is a fundamental concept in electrical engineering that describes how a system or circuit responds to different frequencies of input signals. It provides valuable [[Information Theory|information]] about the behavior of a system in the frequency domain.

In the context of [[Linear Time Invarient Systems|linear time-invariant]] ([[Linear Time Invarient Systems|LTI]]) systems, the frequency response is often represented by the [[Transfer Function|transfer function]], which relates the output of the system to its input in the frequency domain. The [[Transfer Function|transfer function]] is typically denoted as H(ω), where ω represents the angular frequency.

The [[Transfer Function|transfer function]] can be derived from the system's [[Impulse Response|impulse response]], which is the output of the system when an impulse signal is applied as the input. The [[Impulse Response|impulse response]] is denoted as h(t), where t represents time. The [[Transfer Function|transfer function]] H(ω) can be obtained by taking the [[Fourier Transform|Fourier transform]] of the [[Impulse Response|impulse response]]:

$$
H(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(t) e^{-j\omega t} dt
$$

where j is the imaginary unit and ω is the angular frequency.

The frequency response provides [[Information Theory|information]] about how the system amplifies or attenuates different frequencies. It is often represented using a [[Bode Plot|Bode plot]], which consists of two graphs: one for the magnitude response and another for the phase response.

The magnitude response represents the gain or attenuation of the system at different frequencies. It is typically plotted on a logarithmic scale, with frequency (ω) on the x-axis and the magnitude (|H(ω)|) on the y-axis. The magnitude response is expressed in decibels (dB) and can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
|H(\omega)|_{dB} = 20 \log_{10}(|H(\omega)|)
$$

The phase response represents the phase shift introduced by the system at different frequencies. It is typically plotted on a linear scale, with frequency (ω) on the x-axis and the phase (arg(H(ω))) on the y-axis. The phase response is expressed in degrees or radians.

The frequency response of a system can provide insights into its [[LTI System Stability|stability]], [[Signal Bandwidth|bandwidth]], and other important characteristics. For example, a system with a flat magnitude response across a wide range of frequencies is said to have a wide [[Signal Bandwidth|bandwidth]]. On the other hand, a system with a steep roll-off in the magnitude response indicates a limited [[Signal Bandwidth|bandwidth]].

Tangentially related items to frequency response include concepts such as filters, [[Resonance Peak|resonance]], and Fourier analysis. Filters are circuits or systems that selectively pass or attenuate certain frequencies. [[Resonance Peak|Resonance]] occurs when a system exhibits a strong response at a specific frequency. Fourier analysis is a mathematical tool used to decompose a signal into its constituent frequencies.

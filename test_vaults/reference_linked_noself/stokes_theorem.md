# Stokesâ€™ Theorem

Stokes' Theorem is a fundamental principle in vector calculus that relates the flow of a [[Vector Field|vector field]] across a surface to the behavior of the [[Vector Field|vector field]] along the boundary of the surface. It is named after British mathematician Sir George Gabriel Stokes. The theorem is used in various fields such as physics and engineering to solve problems involving fluid flow, electromagnetism, and more. It essentially states that the integral of a differential form over the boundary of a [[Manifold|manifold]] equals the integral of its exterior derivative over the whole [[Manifold|manifold]].

The Stokes' theorem is typically presented as follows:

$$
\begin{gather*}
\int_{\partial \Omega} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \iint_{\Omega} (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot d\mathbf{A}
\end{gather*}
$$

Where $\partial \Omega$ represents the boundary of the surface $\Omega$, $\mathbf{F}$ is a [[Vector Field|vector field]], $d\mathbf{r}$ is a differential length element along the boundary, and $(\nabla \times \mathbf{F})$ is the [[Curl|curl]] of the vector field.

# Stack Memory

Stack memory in computer architecture refers to a specific area of a computer's RAM (Random Access Memory) that is used for temporary storage of data. It operates in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner, meaning the most recently stored data is the first to be retrieved. Stack memory is used for [[Static Memory Allocation|static memory allocation]], and it's primarily involved in function call management within a program. It's faster to allocate in comparison to [[Heap Memory|heap memory]], but it's also limited in size. If a program exceeds the stack capacity, it will result in a stack overflow error.

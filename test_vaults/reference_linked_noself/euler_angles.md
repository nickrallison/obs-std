# [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] Angles

[[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] angles are a set of three angles that describe the orientation of a rigid body in a three-dimensional space. Named after Swiss mathematician [[Leonhard Euler|Leonhard Euler]], these angles provide a way to represent the rotation of an object using three numbers. The three angles are typically denoted as φ (phi), θ (theta), and ψ (psi). The order of these rotations can vary, leading to different sets of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] angles. They are commonly used in physics, engineering, computer graphics, and robotics to describe the orientation of an object in space.

[[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] angles come with the problem of [[Gimbal Lock|Gimbal Lock]], where when at a certain orientation, a degree of freedom is lost and movement is constrained. A more common approach to representing rotation in 3D space is [[Quaternions|Quaternions]] where this problem is avoided.

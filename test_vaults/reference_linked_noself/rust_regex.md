# Rust [[RegEx|Regex]]

Rust's [[Regular Expression|regex]] library provides a way to create and manipulate regular expressions. Regular expressions are a way to match patterns in strings. They are a powerful tool for string manipulation in many programming languages, and Rust is no exception.

The [[Regular Expression|regex]] crate in Rust provides functions to create and manipulate regular expressions. Here's a basic example of how to use it:

```rust
use regex::Regex;

let re = Regex::new(r"^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$").unwrap();
assert!(re.is_match("2014-01-01"));
```

In this example, `r"^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$"` is the regular expression, which matches a date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. The `^` symbol indicates the start of a line, `\d{4}` matches four digits, `-` matches the hyphen character, and `$` indicates the end of a line.

The `unwrap()` function is used here to handle the `Result` returned by `Regex::new`. If the regular expression is invalid, `Regex::new` will return an `Err` value, and `unwrap()` will panic. In a real-world application, you'd likely want to handle this error more gracefully.

The `is_match` function returns a boolean indicating whether the regular expression matches the regular expression/

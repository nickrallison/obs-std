# Dot Product

A dot product, also known as a scalar product, is a [[Binary Operation|binary operation]] that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually coordinate vectors) and returns a single number. In Euclidean space, the dot product of two vectors is the length of one vector times the length of the projection of the other vector onto the first one.

Dot product are commonly used in physics, engineering, computer graphics and machine learning. They are used to calculate the angle between two vectors, to determine whether two vectors are orthogonal (perpendicular), or to compute the work done by a force. In computer graphics, dot products are used in lighting calculations and determining the angle of rotation. In machine learning algorithms like [[Support Vector Machines|support vector machines]] or neural networks, dot products are used for calculating weights or activations.

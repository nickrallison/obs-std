# Warrant Canary

A Warrant Canary is a method by which a communications service provider aims to inform its users that the provider has not been served with a secret government subpoena. Secret subpoenas, such as those covered under 18 U.S.C. ยง2709(c) of the USA PATRIOT Act, come with a gag order forbidding the recipient from disclosing that they have received a subpoena. A Warrant Canary works by publishing a regular notice that no such warrant has been received. If the canary is not updated during the stipulated time period, users are to assume that the service provider has received a subpoena.

The term "Warrant Canary" is a nod to the "canary in the coal mine" concept. Coal miners would carry caged canaries down into the mine with them. If dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide were in the mine, the canary would die before the levels of the gas reached those hazardous to humans. The analogy is that the Warrant Canary would 'die' (i.e., not be published or be removed) if a secret subpoena is received.

The legal status of Warrant Canaries is not entirely clear. The idea is that while a court can compel someone to not speak (via a gag order), it cannot compel someone to lie. Therefore, if a service provider publishes a true statement that it has not received a subpoena, and then receives a subpoena and removes that statement, it has not lied and is not in violation of the order. However, this theory has not been tested in court.

Tangentially related to Warrant Canaries are concepts like encryption, privacy laws, and surveillance. Encryption is a method of protecting information by transforming it into an unreadable format. Only those with a special key can decrypt and read the information. Privacy laws vary by country and dictate what information a party can collect about another party and how that information can be used. Surveillance is the act of watching a person or group of people, often to prevent crime or gather evidence of a crime.

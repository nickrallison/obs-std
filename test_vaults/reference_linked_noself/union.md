# Union

The concept of union in set theory refers to the combination of all unique elements from two or more sets. If you have two sets, the union of these sets is a new set that contains all elements from both original sets, but without any duplicates. For example, if Set A = {1, 2, 3} and Set B = {3, 4, 5}, the union of Set A and Set B (denoted as A âˆª B) would be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. This concept is fundamental to many areas of mathematics and is used in operations involving probability, statistics, and logic.

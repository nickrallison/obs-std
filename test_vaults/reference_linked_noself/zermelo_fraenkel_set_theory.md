# Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory

Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, also known as ZF, is a formal system in mathematical logic that provides the foundation for most of mathematics. It defines the basic concepts and principles of set theory, including the notions of membership, equality, subset, [[Powerset|power set]], [[Union|union]] and [[Intersection|intersection]]. The system is named after Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel who developed it in the early 20th century. It's based on eight [[Mathematical Axioms|axioms]] that avoid paradoxes associated with [[Naive Set Theory|naive set theory]]. These [[Mathematical Axioms|axioms]] include [[Axiom of Extensionality|extensionality]], regularity, [[Axiom Schema of Specification|schema of specification]], pairing, [[Union|union]], [[Powerset|power set]], infinity and [[Axiom of Replacement|axiom of replacement]]. An extended version called ZFC includes an additional [[Mathematical Axioms|axiom]] known as the [[Axiom of Choice|axiom of choice]].

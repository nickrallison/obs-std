# Elliptic Curves

Elliptic curves are a type of cubic curve that have unique properties and applications, particularly in number theory and cryptography. They are defined by equations of the form:

$$
y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
$$

where $a$ and $b$ are constants. This is a simplified form of the general Weierstrass equation for elliptic curves. 

An important property of elliptic curves is that they form a group under a certain operation, often visualized as "dot addition". This operation is defined geometrically: given two points $P$ and $Q$ on the curve, draw the line through $P$ and $Q$. This line will intersect the curve at exactly one more point, $-R$. The point diametrically opposite $-R$ on the curve is defined to be $P + Q$. The [[Identity Element|identity element]] of this group is the "point at infinity", and the inverse of a point $P$ is the point diametrically opposite $P$ on the curve.

Elliptic curves have a rich structure that has been studied in depth in the field of algebraic geometry. They have been used to prove [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat's]] Last Theorem, and they play a crucial role in the theory of modular forms.

In the field of cryptography, the difficulty of the [[Discrete Logarithm Problem|discrete logarithm problem]] on elliptic curves is used to create secure cryptographic systems. This is known as [[Elliptic Curve Cryptography|Elliptic Curve Cryptography]] (ECC).

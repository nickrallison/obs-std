# Ohm's Law

Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in the field of electrical engineering and physics. It states that the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the [[Voltage|voltage]] across the two points, and inversely proportional to the resistance between them. This relationship is often expressed with the formula:

$$
I = \frac{V}{R}
$$

Where:
- $I$ is the current in amperes (A)
- $V$ is the [[Voltage|voltage]] in volts (V)
- $R$ is the resistance in ohms (Î©)

This law is named after the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm, who first formulated it in 1827.

Ohm's Law is a linear relationship, meaning that if you were to graph [[Voltage|voltage]] versus current for a resistor, you would get a straight line. The slope of this line is the resistance.

The law is foundational to the analysis and design of electrical circuits. It's used to calculate unknown values in a circuit (like current, [[Voltage|voltage]], or resistance) when the other two are known.

Ohm's Law can be extended to include power, using the formulas:

$$
P = IV
$$

Where $P$ is power in watts (W), and

$$
P = I^2R = \frac{V^2}{R}
$$

These formulas allow us to calculate power if we know any two of current, [[Voltage|voltage]], or resistance.

Ohm's Law applies to both AC and DC circuits. However, in [[AC Circuits|AC Circuits]], resistance is replaced with impedance, which includes both resistance and reactance (due to capacitors and inductors).

It's important to note that Ohm's Law is an empirical law, meaning it was derived from experimental observations, and it holds true under certain conditions. It applies to conductive materials at constant temperature. Some materials and components (like semiconductors, superconductors, or components at high frequencies) do not obey Ohm's Law.

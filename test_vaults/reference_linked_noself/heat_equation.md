# Heat Equation

The heat equation is a partial [[Differential Equations|differential equation]] that describes how heat distributes over time. It is a fundamental equation in the field of heat conduction and diffusion. The equation is derived from Fourier's law of heat conduction and is used in physics and engineering to predict how heat will flow in a given medium. The equation takes into account the rate of change of temperature, the material's properties, and the spatial distribution of heat. It is used to model a variety of real-world scenarios, such as how heat spreads through a rod or how temperature changes in a room.

The heat equation can be written in the following form:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \nabla^2 u
$$

where $u$ is the temperature, $t$ is the time, $\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity of the material, and $\nabla^2$ is the [[Laplacian Operator|Laplacian Operator]] that represents the spatial part of the equation.

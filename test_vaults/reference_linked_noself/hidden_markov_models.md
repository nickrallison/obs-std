# Hidden Markov Models

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are a statistical tool used for modeling generative sequences characterized by a set of hidden states which are not directly observable but can only be inferred through emitted symbols or observable outputs associated with these states. Within the context of probability and machine learning' HMMs play a pivotal role, providing a framework for understanding sequences of data or temporal data with underlying hidden processes. 

## Background and Fundamentals

At the heart of HMMs lies the Markov process, which is a memoryless stochastic process, implying that the future state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. This characteristic is referred to as the **Markov property**. However, in HMMs, the states through which the process moves are not directly observed but are instead inferred from the observed data that are assumed to be generated by these hidden states. 

### Components of an HMM

An HMM comprises the following components:

- **States**: Hidden states that the model can be in. The states themselves are not directly visible.
- **Observations**: Each state emits an observation, which can be seen. The observation might be discrete (e.g., words in a sentence) or continuous (e.g., stock prices).
- **Transition Probabilities**: The probability of transitioning from one state to another. This forms the core of the Markov process.
- **Emission Probabilities**: The probability of an observation being emitted from a state.
- **Initial State Probabilities**: The probability of the system starting in a particular state.

These components are encapsulated in the mathematical model:

- Let $S = \{S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_N\}$ be a set of N hidden states.
- Let $V = \{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_M\}$ be a set of M possible observations.
- The state transition probabilities are given by $a_{ij} = P(q_{t+1} = S_j | q_t = S_i)$, where $q_t$ is the state at time $t$.
- The observation probability distribution in state $j$ is given by $b_j(k) = P(v_k \text{ at time } t | q_t = S_j)$.
- The initial state distribution is given by $\pi_i = P(q_1 = S_i)$.

## Usage in Machine Learning

In machine learning applications, HMMs are used in various tasks including:

- **Speech Recognition**: Modeling sequences of spoken words or phonemes.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Part-of-speech tagging, where words in a sentence are tagged according to their parts of speech based on the context.
- **Biological Sequence Analysis**: Such as identifying protein or gene sequences from complex biological data.
- **Financial Market Analysis**: Modeling sequences of market states for prediction purposes.

## Learning and Inference in HMMs

Learning and inference in HMMs involve addressing the following three fundamental problems:

1. **Likelihood**: Given the HMM parameters and an observed sequence of data, what is the likelihood of the observed sequence?
2. **Decoding**: Given the observed sequence and the HMM, what is the most likely sequence of hidden states?
3. **Learning**: Given an observed sequence (or sequences), how can we adjust the model parameters to best account for the data?

The first problem is typically addressed using the **Forward-Backward Algorithm**, the second using the **Viterbi Algorithm**, and the third using the **Baum-Welch Algorithm** or **Expectation-Maximization (EM)**.

## Conclusion

Hidden Markov Models represent a powerful probabilistic framework for modeling sequences of data where an underlying process is assumed to be driven by hidden states. Their flexibility and generality make them a crucial tool in both theoretical explorations in probability and practical applications in machine learning.

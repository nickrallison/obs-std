# SR Latch

An SR Latch (Set-Reset Latch) is a basic type of latch circuit in digital electronics that has two stable states and can store one bit of data. It consists of two cross-coupled NOR or NAND gates which can hold and maintain a binary state until it is changed by the input signals. The 'S' stands for set, which sets the state to 1, while 'R' stands for reset, which sets the state to 0. The latch remains in its current state when both inputs are low, but if both inputs are high simultaneously, it results in an invalid condition for NOR-based SR latch and a valid condition for NAND-based SR latch.

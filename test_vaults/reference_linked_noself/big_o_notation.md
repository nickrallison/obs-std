# Big-O Notation

Big-O notation is a mathematical notation used in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It specifically represents the worst-case scenario, or maximum amount of time an operation will require. The notation describes how the run time scales with respect to some input variables when it grows large. For example, if an algorithm has a Big-O of O(n), this means that its complexity or run time increases linearly with the size of the input data set. It provides a high-level understanding of the algorithm's efficiency and helps programmers in making decisions about which approach to choose while coding.

$O$ - Upper Bound  
$\Theta$ - Exact Bound  
$\Omega$ - Lower Bound

# Finite State Machines

Finite State Machines (FSMs) are mathematical models used in computer science and engineering to represent systems or software. They consist of a finite number of states, transitions between these states, and actions. An FSM is in only one state at a time, known as the current state. It can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. The FSM can also produce outputs depending on the current state and input. FSMs are widely used in modeling [[Sequential Logic|sequential logic]] circuits, designing computer programs, and understanding various natural phenomenon.

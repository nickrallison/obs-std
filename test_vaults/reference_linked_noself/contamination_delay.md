# Contamination Delay

Contamination delay refers to the minimum time required for a signal at the input of a digital circuit to affect the output. It is often used in timing analysis of digital systems, particularly in synchronous circuits where it's critical to maintain proper timing relationships between signals. It's important to manage contamination delay to prevent glitches or errors in the system. The delay depends on various factors such as load, temperature, [[Voltage|voltage]], and manufacturing process variations.

# Epsilon-Greedy

The Epsilon-Greedy strategy is a method used in [[Reinforcement Learning|reinforcement learning]] for balancing exploration and exploitation. It's a simple yet effective approach to handle the trade-off between exploration (trying out new actions to improve future rewards) and exploitation (choosing the best-known action to maximize immediate reward).

The strategy works as follows: with probability $1 - \epsilon$, the agent selects the action that has the highest estimated reward (exploitation), and with probability $\epsilon$, the agent selects an action randomly (exploration). Here, $\epsilon$ is a parameter that controls the degree of exploration vs. exploitation, with values typically between 0 and 1.

The mathematical representation of the Epsilon-Greedy policy can be written as:

$$
\pi(a|s) = 
\begin{cases} 
1 - \epsilon + \frac{\epsilon}{|A(s)|}, & \text{if } a = \arg\max_{a \in A(s)} Q(s, a) \\
\frac{\epsilon}{|A(s)|}, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

where:
- $\pi(a|s)$ is the probability of taking action $a$ in state $s$ under policy $\pi$,
- $Q(s, a)$ is the action-value function, representing the expected return of taking action $a$ in state $s$,
- $A(s)$ is the set of all possible actions in state $s$,
- $|A(s)|$ is the number of possible actions in state $s$.

The Epsilon-Greedy strategy is simple to implement and understand, but it has some limitations. For instance, it treats all actions equally, regardless of their estimated values. This can lead to suboptimal performance, as the agent might waste time exploring obviously inferior actions.

Tangentially related to Epsilon-Greedy are other exploration strategies like [[Upper Confidence Bound|Upper Confidence Bound]] ([[Upper Confidence Bound|UCB]]) and Thompson Sampling, which try to address some of the limitations of Epsilon-Greedy. [[Upper Confidence Bound|UCB]], for example, balances exploration and exploitation based on uncertainty or [[Variance|variance]] in the estimated values of actions, while Thompson Sampling uses a Bayesian approach to model the uncertainty in the action-value estimates.

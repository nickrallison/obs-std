# Logical Equivalence

Logical equivalence is a concept in formal logic that refers to two statements being logically equivalent if they have the same logical content. This means that they always have the same truth value, regardless of the truth values of their components. In other words, if one statement is true, then the other statement is also true, and vice versa. Logical equivalence is a fundamental concept in the study of logic and plays a crucial role in logical reasoning and argumentation.

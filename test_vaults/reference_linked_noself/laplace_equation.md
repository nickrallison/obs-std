# [[Pierre Simone Laplace|Laplace]] Equation

The [[Pierre Simone Laplace|Laplace]] Equation is a second-order partial [[Differential Equations|differential equation]] named after [[Pierre Simone Laplace|Pierre-Simon Laplace]], a French mathematician. It is the simplest example of elliptic partial [[Differential Equations|differential equations]]. The general theory of solutions to [[Pierre Simone Laplace|Laplace's]] equation is known as potential theory. The solutions of [[Pierre Simone Laplace|Laplace's]] equation are the harmonic functions, which are important in many fields of science, notably the fields of physics, engineering, and mathematics. The [[Pierre Simone Laplace|Laplace]] Equation often describes steady-state scenarios in physical systems, such as heat conduction, fluid flow, and electromagnetic fields.

These [[Differential Equations|differential equations]] can also be described as the set of functions $\phi$ such that when the [[Laplacian Operator|Laplacian Operator]] is applied, the function is 0 everywhere

The [[Pierre Simone Laplace|Laplace]] equation in Cartesian coordinates can be written as follows:

$$
\begin{gather*} 
\nabla^2 \phi = \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial z^2} = 0
\end{gather*}
$$

Here, $\nabla^2$ is the [[Laplacian Operator|Laplacian Operator]] and $\phi$ is a scalar function.

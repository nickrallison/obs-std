# Logical Connectives

Logical connectives, also known as logical operators, are symbols or words used to connect two or more sentences in a way that the compound sentence produced has its truth value dependent on the truth values of its components. They are fundamental concepts in logic, a branch of philosophy and mathematics. The most common logical connectives include "and" (conjunction), "or" (disjunction), "not" (negation), "if…then…" (implication), and "if and only if" (biconditional). Each of these connectives follows a specific set of rules or truth tables that determine the truth value of the compound statement.

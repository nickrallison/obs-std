# Mathematical Axioms

Mathematical axioms are basic principles or fundamental statements that are accepted without proof and used as a starting point for developing mathematical theories. They are the building blocks of mathematical logic and reasoning. Axioms are considered self-evident truths, which means they are universally accepted once they have been stated. These principles form the basis for all other mathematical proofs and theorems. For example, in geometry, Euclid's axioms form the foundation of Euclidean geometry.

Other axioms include the axioms of [[Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory|Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory]] on which most of modern mathematics are based. A system of mathematics is based on a set of axioms but there is not necessarily one true set, since the [[Axiom of Choice|Axiom of Choice]] and the [[Axiom Of Determinacy|Axiom Of Determinacy]] create [[Contradictions|contradictions]]

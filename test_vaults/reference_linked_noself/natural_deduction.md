# Natural Deduction

Natural Deduction is a method used in logic to create valid arguments and prove statements. It involves applying inference rules, which are logical structures that allow one to derive a conclusion from one or more premises. The goal of natural deduction is to show that a particular conclusion logically follows from the given premises. This approach is called natural because it mirrors the way humans naturally reason in everyday life.

From these rules, all other common rules can be derived like [[Demorgan's Laws|Demorgans Laws]]

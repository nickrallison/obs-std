# Static Memory Allocation

Static memory allocation is a method of memory management in which the memory required by a program is determined at compile time. This means that the size and storage of the allocated memory is fixed when the program is created and does not change during the program's execution. 

In static memory allocation, variables have a fixed memory location throughout the program's execution. This method is used for global variables, file scope variables, and local variables declared with the static keyword. The memory for these variables is allocated once when the program starts and is deallocated when the program ends.

The primary advantage of static memory allocation is its simplicity and efficiency. Because the memory is allocated at compile time, there is no need for complex memory management algorithms at runtime. This can lead to faster program execution. However, the downside is that it can lead to wasted memory if the allocated memory is not fully utilized. It also lacks flexibility, as the memory size cannot be changed during runtime.

Here's a simple example in C programming language:

```c
#include<stdio.h>

void func() {
   static int count = 0;
   count++;
   printf("%d ", count);
}

int main() {
   func();
   func();
   return 0;
}
```

In this example, the variable `count` is declared as static inside the function `func`. This means that `count` retains its value between function calls. So, the output of this program will be `1 2`, not `1 1`.

- [[Dynamic Memory Allocation|Dynamic memory allocation]] is the opposite of static memory allocation. It allows memory to be allocated and deallocated during runtime, providing more flexibility but also requiring more complex memory management.
- [[Stack Memory|Stack memory]] is used for static memory allocation, while [[Heap Memory|heap memory]] is used for [[Dynamic Memory Allocation|dynamic memory allocation]].
- Memory management algorithms are used in [[Dynamic Memory Allocation|dynamic memory allocation]] to decide which parts of memory to allocate to processes.

Please note that the concept of static memory allocation is more related to the logic of programming and memory management, and does not involve mathematical formulas, derivations, or proofs.

# D Flip Flop

A D flip-flop, also known as a data or delay flip-flop, is a type of flip-flop used in digital electronics. It is a fundamental building block of many digital systems, including computer memory and data registers.

The D flip-flop captures the value of the D-input at a definite portion of the clock cycle (such as the rising edge of the clock). That captured value becomes the Q output. At other times, the output Q does not change. The D flip-flop can be viewed as a memory cell, a zero-order hold, or a delay line.

The D flip-flop has two inputs: D (data) and CLK (clock), and two outputs: Q and $\overline{Q}$ (the inverse of Q). The operation of the D flip-flop is as follows:

- On each rising edge of the clock signal (CLK), the output Q takes the value of the D input at the time of the rising edge.
- The output $\overline{Q}$ is always the inverse of Q.

The truth table for a D flip-flop is:

| D | CLK | Q (next) |
|---|-----|----------|
| 0 | ↑   | 0        |
| 1 | ↑   | 1        |

The D flip-flop can be implemented using a pair of 3-state buffers or "gates". Here is a simple schematic:

```
D >--|>|---+---> Q
     |       |
CLK -+-------+
     |       |
     >--|<|--+---> /Q
```

The arrows represent the 3-state buffers. The CLK signal controls which buffer is "on" (allowing data through) and which is "off" (blocking data). When CLK is high, the D input can pass to the Q output. When CLK is low, the Q output holds its previous state.

D flip-flops are used in many digital systems because of their ability to "remember" a binary state. They are used in shift registers, counters, and memory units. They are also used in systems where a specific state or sequence of states is required, such as in finite state machines.

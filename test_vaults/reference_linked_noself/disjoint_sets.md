# Disjoint Sets

Disjoint sets, also known as non-overlapping sets, are a type of set in mathematics where no element is common between any two sets. In other words, the [[Intersection|intersection]] of these sets is empty. For example, if we have two sets A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5, 6}, these two are disjoint because they do not share any common elements. Disjoint sets are often used in various fields of mathematics and computer science such as in graph theory and database systems.

$$
\begin{gather*} 
A = \{1, 2, 3\} \\
B = \{4, 5, 6\} \\
A \cap B = \emptyset
\end{gather*}
$$

## Example
Lets consider three sets C = {7, 8, 9}, D = {10, 11, 12} and E = {13, 14, 15}. Are these sets disjoint?

Solution:

$$
\begin{gather*} 
C = \{7, 8, 9\} \\
D = \{10, 11, 12\} \\
E = \{13, 14, 15\} \\
C \cap D = \emptyset \\
C \cap E = \emptyset \\
D \cap E = \emptyset \\
\text{Therefore, the sets C, D and E are disjoint.}
\end{gather*}
$$

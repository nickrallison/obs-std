# Uniform Distribution

The Uniform Distribution is a type of probability distribution in statistics where all outcomes are equally likely. It is a [[Continuous Distribution|continuous distribution]], meaning that it takes values within a specified range. The distribution is defined by two parameters, the minimum and maximum values, which represent the range of possible values. The probability for all outcomes is the same, hence the term "uniform". It is often represented graphically as a rectangle, with the height representing the constant probability. This distribution is commonly used in statistics and in various fields such as physics, engineering, computer science, and economics.

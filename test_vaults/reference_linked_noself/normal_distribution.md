# Normal Distribution

The Normal Distribution, also known as Gaussian distribution, is a type of [[Continuous Distribution|continuous probability distribution]] for a real-valued [[Random Variable|random variable]]. It is one of the most important probability distributions in statistics due to its numerous beneficial properties. The distribution is [[Symmetric Relation|symmetric]] and its mean, [[Median|median]] and mode are equal. It is characterised by its bell-shaped curve where the data points are concentrated around the peak which represents the highest probability. The shape of the normal distribution depends on the mean and the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]]. The [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] determines how much variation there is from the mean or [[Expected Value|expected value]]. Larger [[Standard Deviation|standard deviations]] lead to more spread out distributions. Normal distributions are commonly used in natural and social sciences to represent real-valued [[Random Variable|random variables]] whose distributions are not known or cannot be easily determined from data.

The formula for a Normal Distribution is given by:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{ -\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

where:
- $x$ is the variable.
- $\mu$ is the mean or [[Expected Value|expected value]] of the distribution.
- $\sigma$ is the [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]].
- $f(x)$ gives the probability density at point $x$.
- $e$ is [[Leonhard Euler|Euler's]] number, a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828.

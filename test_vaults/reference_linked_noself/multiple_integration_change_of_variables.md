# [[Multiple Integration|Multiple Integration]] Change of Variables

[[Multiple Integration|Multiple integration]] change of variables, also known as variable substitution in [[Multiple Integration|multiple integrals]], is a method used in calculus to simplify complex integrals. This technique involves replacing a set of variables with another set that makes the integral easier to solve.

The process is similar to the use of substitution in single-variable calculus, but it extends to multiple variables. It involves determining a suitable transformation that simplifies the region of integration or the integrand itself. The [[Jacobians|Jacobian determinant]], which gives us the factor by which areas or volumes change under the transformation, plays a crucial role in this process.

This method is particularly useful when dealing with integrals over regions that are difficult to describe in Cartesian coordinates but become simpler in other coordinate systems such as polar, cylindrical, or spherical coordinates. Its also used when the function inside the integral becomes simpler after changing variables.

In essence, [[Multiple Integration|multiple integration]] change of variables is a powerful tool for solving complex integrals by transforming them into more manageable forms.

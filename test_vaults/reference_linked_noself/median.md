# Median

The median is a measure of central tendency in statistics. It represents the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. To find the median, you first arrange the data in order and then identify the middle value. If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the [[Expected Value|average]] of the two middle values.

The median is useful in situations where extreme values or outliers can significantly affect the mean. Unlike the mean, which is sensitive to extreme values, the median is resistant to outliers. This makes it a preferred measure of central tendency when dealing with skewed distributions or datasets with extreme values.

Here are some scenarios where the median is preferred over the mean and mode:

1. Skewed distributions: When the data is not symmetrically distributed and has a long tail on one side, the median provides a better representation of the central value. For example, in income data, where a few high-income earners can significantly affect the mean, the median provides a more accurate measure of the typical income.

2. Ordinal data: When dealing with ordinal data, where the values have a natural order but the intervals between them may not be equal, the median is a suitable measure. For example, in a survey where respondents rate a product on a scale of 1 to 5, the median can provide a better understanding of the typical rating.

3. Outliers: When there are extreme values or outliers in the dataset, the median is less affected compared to the mean. For example, in a dataset of test scores where one student has an unusually high or low score, the median can give a better representation of the typical performance.

However, there are situations where the median may not be the most appropriate measure of central tendency:

1. Symmetrical distributions: When the data is symmetrically distributed, the mean and median are usually similar. In such cases, the mean may provide a more precise measure of central tendency.

2. Interval or ratio data: When dealing with interval or ratio data, where the intervals between values are equal, the mean is often preferred. This is because the mean takes into account the magnitude of the values and can provide a more accurate representation of the [[Expected Value|average]].

In summary, the median is a measure of central tendency that is useful in situations where extreme values or skewed distributions can affect the mean. It is preferred over the mean and mode when dealing with skewed data, ordinal data, or when outliers are present. However, in symmetrical distributions or when working with interval or ratio data, the mean may be a more appropriate measure of central tendency.

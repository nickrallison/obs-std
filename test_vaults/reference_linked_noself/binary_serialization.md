# Binary Serialization

Binary serialization is a process of converting an object into a binary format that can be stored or transmitted and then reconstructed later. This process is used in computing for various purposes such as storing data in files or memory, transmitting data over a network, or for inter-process communication.

The primary advantage of binary serialization over other forms (like XML or JSON) is efficiency. Binary data is compact, and the serialization/deserialization process is typically faster. However, it's less human-readable and less interoperable between different programming languages or platforms.

Here's a basic example of how binary serialization might work in a hypothetical programming language:

```python
class ExampleObject:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a = a
        self.b = b

# Create an instance of the object
obj = ExampleObject(123, "abc")

# Serialize the object to a binary format
binary_data = serialize_to_binary(obj)

# The binary_data can now be written to a file, sent over a network, etc.
```

In this example, the `serialize_to_binary` function would need to take the `ExampleObject` instance and convert it into a binary format. This could involve converting the integer `a` and the string `b` into binary, and then concatenating these [[Binary Representation|binary representations]] together along with some additional [[Information Theory|information]] to indicate where `a` ends and `b` begins.

Binary serialization can become quite complex when dealing with more complex data structures, such as nested objects, arrays, or circular references. Different programming languages and libraries have different ways of handling these complexities.
